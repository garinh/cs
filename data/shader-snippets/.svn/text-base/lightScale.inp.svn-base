<!-- Scaling factors for computed light values
     To be applied to results/before using certain lighting values.
     (This is done to work around limited precision issues on PS1.x.)
     
     lightScale.x should be multiplied in when a lighting value is saved;
     lightScale.y should be multiplied with when the lighting value is used.
