What is VSH?

VSH stands for "Virtual Shell". In short it is a testbed for Virtual File
System, which resides in the `vfs' plugin. If you can't understand why some
files are not found by your program, or why some files are taken from wrong
places, or you want to understand how VFS works at all, VSH is the right place
to look.

The command-line oriented interface of VSH is quite similar to Unix shells.
If you're common at least with one Unix-like shell (or even with COMMAND.COM)
you will understand what to do. If not, don't bother.

To get a short list of available commands type "help".
