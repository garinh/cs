   *       hard transforms can be used to move a thing with this flag. This
   *       setting is both efficient for memory (object space coordinates are
   *       equal to world space coordinates so only one array is kept) and
   *       render speed (only the camera transform is needed). This option
   *       is very useful for static geometry like walls.
   *       This option is default.
   * - CS_THING_MOVE_OCCASIONAL: this option is set for a thing that
   *       is movable but doesn't move all the time usually. Setting this
   *       option means that the world space vertices will be cached (taking
   *       up more memory that way) but the coordinates will be recalculated
   *       only at rendertime (and cached at that time). This option has
   *       the same speed efficiency as MOVE_NEVER when the object doesn't
   *       move but more memory is used as all the vertices are duplicated.
   *       Use this option for geometry that is not too big (in number of
   *       vertices) and only moves occasionally like doors of elevators.
   * 
   * Note: it is no longer needed to manually set this option. By default
   * things will use CS_THING_MOVE_NEVER and they will automatically switch
   * to the slightly less efficient CS_THING_MOVE_OCCASIONAL if needed.
