# Some external projects use gcc's -ansi and -pedantic options. We need to
# ensure that CS's public headers are usable when these options are enabled,
# Unfortunately, we can not enable these options globally since CS uses some
# features (such as `long long') which are not available in the present
# language standard. As a compromise, we enable these restrictions on an
# individual module basis so as to ensure that the CS headers are tested
# against these options on a regular basis.
