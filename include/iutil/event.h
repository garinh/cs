/**\page Keyboard Keyboard events
 * Keyboard events are emitted when the user does something with the keyboard -
 * presses down a key ("key down" events), holds it down (more "key down" 
 * events in a specific interval - "auto-repeat") and releases it ("key up").
 *
 * Every keyboard event has a bunch of data associated with it. First, there is
 * a code to identify the key: the 'raw' code. It uniquely identifies the key,
 * and every key has a distinct code, independent from any pressed modifiers:
 * For example, pressing the "A" key will always result in the raw code 'a',
 * holding shift or any other modifier down won't change it. However, the
 * 'cooked' code contains such additional information: If Shift+A is pressed,
 * the cooked code will be 'A', while the raw code is still 'a'.  Other keys
 * are also normalized; for example keypad keys: pressing "9" will result in
 * either CSKEY_PGUP or '9', depending on the NumLock state.  So, the same key
 * can result in different 'cooked' codes, and the same 'cooked' code can be
 * caused by different keys.
 *
 * Other data contained in a keyboard event is:
 * \li Whether it is a key up or down event
 * \li Whether it is an autorepeat of an earlier keypress
 * \li Modifiers at the time of the keypress
 * \li When it is a character, whether it is a normal or dead character
 * 
 * Keyboard event data is stored as properties of iEvent, accessible thorugh
 * iEvent->Find() and iEvent->Add().
 * <table>
 * <tr><td><b>Property Name</b></td><td><b>Type</b></td>
 *  <td><b>Description</b></td></tr>
 * <tr><td>keyEventType</td><td>csKeyEventType (stored as uint8)</td>
 *  <td>Event type (up vs down)</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>keyCodeRaw</td><td>uint32</td><td>Raw key code</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>keyCodeCooked</td><td>uint32</td><td>Cooked key code</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>keyModifiers</td><td>csKeyModifiers</td><td>Modifiers at time of 
 *  the key press</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>keyAutoRepeat</td><td>bool</td><td>Autorepeat flag</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>keyCharType</td><td>csKeyCharType (stored as uint8)</td>
 *  <td>Character type</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * A way to retrieve an keyboard event's data without requiring a plethora
 * of iEvent->Find() invocations provides the csKeyEventHelper class.
 *
 * Also see iKeyComposer for informations about composing accented etc.
 * characters from dead and normal keys.
