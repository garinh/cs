   * event's type.) If you do override this method in order to optionally
   * delegate event handling to some other entity, then you must remember to
   * invoke csBaseEventHandler::HandleEvent() if the other entity did not
   * handle the event. (Given the AWS example, this means that if
   * iAWS::HandleEvent() returns false, the event should be passed along to
   * csBaseEventHandler::HandleEvent() so that csBaseEventHandler can dispatch
