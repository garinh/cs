 * A quick-allocation pool for storage of arbitrary data. Pointers to
 * allocations made from the pool are guaranteed to remain valid as long as the
 * pool is alive; the pool contents are never relocated.  All individually
 * allocated memory chunks are freed when the pool itself is destroyed.  This
 * memory management scheme is suitable for algorithms which need to allocate
 * and manipulate many chunks of memory in a non-linear fashion where the
 * life-time of each memory chunk is not predictable. Rather than complicating
 * the algorithm by having it carefully track each memory chunk to determine
 * when it would be safe to dispose of the memory, it can instead create a
 * csMemoryPool at the start, and destroy the pool at the end.  During
 * processing, it can allocate memory chunks from the pool as needed, and
 * simply forget about them when no longer needed, knowing that they will be
 * freed en-masse when the pool itself is disposed.  This is often a cheaper,
 * simpler, and faster alternative to reference-counting or automatic garbage
 * collection.
