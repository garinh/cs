 * recommended that you query the object registry for this object by simply
 * asking for the object implementing iOSXAssistant.

 *  functionality compiles properly on all other platforms, the use of the
 *  interface and inclusion of the header file should be surrounded by
 *  appropriate '\#if defined(CS_PLATFORM_MACOSX) ... \#endif' statements.
