 * A weak reference. This is a reference to a reference counted object
 * but in itself it doesn't increment the ref counter. As soon as the
 * object is destroyed (i.e. the last REAL reference to it is removed)
 * all weak references pointing to that object are cleared. This kind of
 * reference is useful if you want to maintain some kind of cached objects
 * that can safely be removed as soon as the last reference to it is gone.
 * 
 * Note: this class assumes that the T type implements at least the following
 * functions:
 * - AddRefOwner()
 * - RemoveRefOwner()
 *
 * \remarks An extended explanation on smart pointers - how they work and what
 *   type to use in what scenario - is contained in the User's manual, 
 *   section "Correctly Using Smart Pointers".
