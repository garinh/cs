/**
 * Color quantizer.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm presented here is a variation of well-known and widely-used
 * Heckbert quantization algorithm. It works in the following way: first,
 * we build a 3-D histogram that describes which colors and how many times
 * the corresponding colors were used. Since we deal with RGB images, all
 * possible colors counts to 256^3 = 16777216 colors, too much to keep in
 * memory. Because of this, we ignore several lowest bits from each color
 * component, taking into consideration human eye's sensivity to different
 * color components we take 5 bits for R, 6 bits for G and 4 bits for B.
 * This summary reduces to 32*64*16 = 32768 histogram cells, which is
 * a reasonable size for an dynamically-allocated array.
 * <p>
 * Next, we take the entire color box and split it into subboxes.
 * The split happens along the longest of R,G,B axis into half
 * (and taking again into account eye sensivity). After which we take
 * again the biggest box, and split it again and so on until we
 * have that much boxes how much colors we want. Then we assign to each
 * box a color index, and compute the median RGB value for each box.
 * <p>
 * To keep memory requirements in reasonable bounds, we scale down R/G/B
 * components to 5/6/4 bits respectively. This produces results that are
 * different from those we'll get with, say, 6/7/6 resolution but its
 * a quite suitable solution, for a quality vs speed choice. I've tried
 * 5/6/5 as well as 6/6/4 and its really hard to say they are better -
 * the results are definitely different but it's hard to say they are
 * really better.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: If the sum of R+G+B bits exceeds 16, you will a need special
 * case for big endian machines for the INDEX_B macro (see below). With
 * big-endian machines the B component starts at bit 8, thus the right
 * shift counter becomes negative. Probably the best solution is to add
 * an \#if B_BIT + 8 - HIST_B_BITS - HIST_G_BITS - HIST_R_BITS < 0.
 * 
 * <b>Quantizing</b><br>
 * The following routines can be used to split the quantization process
 * into small steps. First, you should call Begin(). This will
 * allocate some memory for color histogram and also do some other
 * maintenance work. Then you call Count () as much times as
 * you want, to count the frequencies of colors. This is a quite fast
 * operation, thus you can use it, for example, to compute a optimal
 * palette for a large number of images (for example, software 3D renderer
 * uses it for computing the optimal palette in paletted modes, by passing
 * every texture to Count()).
 * <p>
 * When you're finished with images, call Palette(). This will
 * compute the optimal palette. If you need just that, you can call
 * End() and you're done. If you need to remap all those textures
 * to the optimal palette, you can call Remap() as much times
 * as you wish. Finally you anyway should call End() to free
 * all the memory used by quantizer.
 * <p>
 * Now, a typical quantization sequence could look like this:
 * \code
 * Begin ();
 *
 *    Count (image, pixels);
 *   Count (...);
 *   ...
 *
 *   int maxcolors = 256;
 *   Palette (outpalette, maxcolors);
 *   // now maxcolors contains the actual number of palette entries
 *
 *   Remap (image, pixels, outimage);
 *   Remap (...);
 *   ...
 *
 * End ();
 * \endcode
 * The quantizer itself keeps track of its current state, and will silently
 * ignore invalid calls. For example, if you call Remap() right
 * after calling Begin() nothing will happen. You still can call
 * Palette() right after Begin(), and you will get the
 * expected black (or let's call it `empty') palette.
 *<p>
 * The Bias routine can be used to introduce a bias inside the
 * currently open color histogram towards given colors. The "weight"
 * parameter shows how important those colors are (0 - not at all, 100 -
 * very). This can be used to bias the resulting palette towards some
 * hard-coded values, for example you may want to use it to create a
 * relatively uniform palette that is somewhat biased towards the colors
 * contained in some picture(s).
 *<p>
 * Some routines accept an additional parameter (csRGBpixel *transp). If it
 * is 0, nothing special is performed. If it is non-0, it should point
 * to an valid csRGBpixel object; the color of that pixel will be treated in
 * a special way: Count() will ignore pixels of that color,
 * Palette() will allocate color index 0 for that color, and
 * Remap will map all such pixel values to index 0.
