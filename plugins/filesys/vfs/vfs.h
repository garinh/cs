/**
 * The Virtual Filesystem Class is intended to be the only way for Crystal
 * Space engine to access the files. This gives unified control over the
 * way how files are found, read and written. VFS gives the following
 * goodies over the standard file i/o functions:
 * - Multiple search directories. Several "real" directories can be
 *   collected together into one "virtual" directory.
 * - Directories can be mapped to "real" directories as well as to
 *   archives (.zip files). Files are compressed/decompressed
 *   transparently for clients.
 * - The Virtual File System is unique across all operating systems
 *   Crystal Space supports, no matter of features of the underlying OS.
 *
 * This class has only most basic features of a real filesystem: file
 * reading and writing (no simultaneous read and write mode are allowed
 * because it would be rather complex to implement it for archives).
 * However, most programs don't even need such functionality, and for
 * sure Crystal Space itself doesn't need it. Files open for writing are
 * always truncated. A simple meaning for getting a list of files in a
 * virtual directory is implemented; however the user is presented with
 * only a list of file names; no fancy things like file size, time etc
 * (file size can be determined after opening it for reading).
