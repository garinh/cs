- Separate the outline info from csObjectModel. An outline is not attached
  to a model but to an instance of a model (perhaps make
  csObjectModelInstance?).
	OR
  Implement an outline cache which IS attached to csObjectModel and let
  model instances use an entry from that cache.

- Improve filling of outline in coverage buffer. Clamp outline to Z=0
  plane instead of rejecting write objects that are clipped by that plane.

- Implement delayed writing on tiles.

- Predict quality of occluders.

- VPT (Visible Point Tracking).

- Only calculate planes, edges, active edges in model when REALLY
  needed (i.e. delay).

- Also process history and VPT for kdtree nodes.

- Separate all camera dependend/history data so we can use Dynavis
  for multiple camera positions. In fact all information related to an
  object can be split into three classes:
  	- Information on the model itself. This is independent of where
	  the model is at some time (movable) and also independent
	  of the camera position.
	- Information on the current location of the object. This is
	  independent from the camera but depends on the movable and will
	  be updated when the movable is updated.
	- Information depending on camera position.

- 3 Bit coverage flush.

- Fix Dynavis in combination with a mirror.
