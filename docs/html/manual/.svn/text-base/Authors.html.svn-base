<h2 class="section"> 1.11 Documentation Authors &amp; Contributors </h2>

<p>Documentation for the Crystal Space project has been written and edited by
numerous volunteers.  This section pays tribute to both the major
documentation contributors as well as the minor ones.  In cases where a
section or chapter has been wholly authored or extensively edited by a single
individual, notice of that contribution is included as part of the section or
chapter itself.
</p>
<p>The following people have made significant contributions to the Crystal Space
documentation by authoring large portions of this manual, often with entire
chapters or sections to their name.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Jorrit Tyberghein (<a href="mailto:jorrit.tyberghein@gmail.com">jorrit.tyberghein@gmail.com</a>)

<p>As the creator of Crystal Space, Jorrit wrote the original documentation
included with the package.  Although some of that original work has since been
superceded by more recent work by himself and others, much of his writing can
still be found in this document.  In particular, he has authored several
sections which detail inner workings of the 3D engine as well as sections
which describe the theory behind the engine.
</p>
</li><li>
Andrew Zabolotny (<a href="mailto:bit@eltech.ru">bit@eltech.ru</a>)

<p>Andrew has contributed several sections to this manual which document the
various large-scale contributions which he has made to the project.  They
include the <small>SCF</small> and <small>VFS</small> systems, <small>CSWS</small>, MazeD, memory debugger,
makefiles, and detailed information pertaining to the <small>OS/2</small> port.
</p>
</li><li>
Eric Sunshine (<a href="mailto:sunshine@sunshineco.com">sunshine@sunshineco.com</a>)

<p>In addition to writing several documents describing various ports of Crystal
Space in detail, Eric took on the task of acting as master editor of this
manual.  As part of this job, he has written much of the content which ties
together the various portions of the manual, fleshed out much of the bare
skeleton, written many otherwise absent sections, and performed the extensive
mathematical typesetting found throughout the manual.  His editing efforts
have been very extensive, and he is responsible for the manual's current
organization, look, and feel.  He also created several utilities and Texinfo
extension packages which allow the documentation to build cleanly on all
platforms supported by Crystal Space.
</p>
</li><li>
Frank Richter (<a href="mailto:res@crystalspace3d.org">res@crystalspace3d.org</a>)

<p>Frank has written much <small>API</small> documentation, as well as having contributed
material to the Crystal Space manual.
</p></li></ul>

<p>The following list of people have contributed to the Crystal Space
documentation effort in various ways over time.  In some cases their work has
become obsolete or has been superceded by more recent work and is, therefore,
absent from this manual, but we thank them anyhow.  This list is ordered
alphabetically by surname.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
David Asbell (<a href="mailto:dasbell@yahoo.com">dasbell@yahoo.com</a>)

<p>David contributed the binary sprite loader and saver to <small>CS</small>.
</p>
</li><li>
Robert Bate (<a href="mailto:rbate@mac.com">rbate@mac.com</a>)

<p>Robert wrote the documentation detailing the pre-Carbon Macintosh port of
Crystal Space which he also maintains.
</p>
</li><li>
Andreas Busch (<a href="mailto:nobita@t-online.de">nobita@t-online.de</a>)

<p>Andreas wrote documentation explaining how to build Crystal Space with
KDevelop.  He also made a very thorough proof-reading pass through the entire
user manual and spotted and corrected a large number of typographical problems.
</p>
</li><li>
Brandon Ehle (<a href="mailto:azverkan@yahoo.com">azverkan@yahoo.com</a>)

<p>Brandon initiated the aborted attempt to convert Crystal Space documentation
to LaTeX.  As part of this task, he made an initial effort to organize the
diverse and unrelated existing documents which were maintained as plain text
and <small>HTML</small>.  The attempted LaTeX conversion predates the current manual
which is maintained in Texinfo format.
</p>
</li><li>
Michael Ewert (<a href="mailto:mewert99@yahoo.com">mewert99@yahoo.com</a>)

<p>Michael wrote the documentation for Crystal Space's Phyziks library, of which
he is the author and principal maintainer.

</li><li>
Desmond Fletcher (<a href="mailto:desmond.fletcher@usm.edu">desmond.fletcher@usm.edu</a>)

<p>Desmond updated <tt>&lsquo;map2cs&rsquo;</tt> documentation by adding new classnames and keys.
</p>
</li><li>
Chris Forno (<a href="mailto:jcore@arbornet.org">jcore@arbornet.org</a>)

<p>Chris took on the challenge of bringing the Crystal Space documentation
up-to-date in June of 2002. He is also actively working on editing and
unifying the existing documentation in preparation for the 1.0 release.
</p>
</li><li>
Seth Galbraith (<a href="mailto:sgalbrai@linknet.kitsap.lib.wa.us">sgalbrai@linknet.kitsap.lib.wa.us</a>)

<p>Seth wrote the documentation for the <small>DJGPP</small> port of Crystal Space.  He also
provided a more organized entry-point to the old text-based documentation
by creating an easily navigated <small>HTML</small> cover page.
</p>
</li><li>
Martin Geisse (<a href="mailto:Hellwig.Geisse@mni.fh-giessen.de">Hellwig.Geisse@mni.fh-giessen.de</a>)

<p>As part of the effort to generate a unified Crystal Space manual, Martin
converted many of the Crystal Space plain text and LaTeX documents to Texinfo
format.
</p>
</li><li>
Mike Gist (<a href="mailto:xordan@gmail.com">xordan@gmail.com</a>)

<p>Mike updated the threading section of the manual with information on the

David Huen (<a href="mailto:smh1008@cus.cam.ac.uk">smh1008@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>)

<p>David wrote some detailed documentation about the BeOS port of Crystal Space
while studying the original port.  Since that time, most of David's work on
this documentation has been superceded by Eric Sunshine following Eric's
major overhaul of the BeOS port.
</p>
</li><li>
Michael Dale Long (<a href="mailto:mlong@custom.net">mlong@custom.net</a>)

<p>Michael wrote detailed documentation about the Crystal Clear project, of which
he is the principal developer, and which is layered atop Crystal Space.
Crystal Clear has now been removed from the Crystal Space project however
due to lack of maintenance and interest.
</p>
</li><li>
Nathaniel Saint Martin (<a href="mailto:noote@bigfoot.com">noote@bigfoot.com</a>)
