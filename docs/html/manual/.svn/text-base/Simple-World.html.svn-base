<h4 class="subsubsection"> 4.2.1.3 Creating a &ldquo;World&rdquo; </h4>

<p>Now we have a very exciting application which opens a black window and waits
for the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key to quit.  We assume this is the application you always
wanted to have?  No?  Ok then, let's create some 3D stuff.
</p>
<p>We'll add a texture manager, a room (technically called a
<em>sector</em>) and some lights.  First, add a pointer to our main
sector and a function <code>CreateRoom()</code> to the <samp>&lsquo;Simple&rsquo;</samp> class
header file:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">
class Simple
{
private:
  ...
  iSector* room;
  float rotX, rotY;
  ...
  void CreateRoom ();
  ...
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Now add these chunks of code (texture manager, room, lights) to
<tt>&lsquo;simple.cpp&rsquo;</tt>:
</p>
<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">bool Simple::SetupModules ()
{
  ...
  // These are used store the current orientation of the camera.
  rotY = rotX = 0;
  ...
  CreateRoom ()
  
  engine-&gt;Prepare ();

  using namespace CS::Lighting;
  SimpleStaticLighter::ShineLights (room, engine, 4);

  rm = engine-&gt;GetRenderManager();
  ...
}
...
void Simple::CreateRoom ()
{
  if (!loader-&gt;LoadTexture (&quot;brick&quot;, &quot;/lib/std/castle/brick1_d.jpg&quot;))
    ReportError(&quot;Error loading 'brick1_d' texture!&quot;);
  iMaterialWrapper* tm = engine-&gt;GetMaterialList ()-&gt;FindByName (&quot;brick&quot;);
  
  room = engine-&gt;CreateSector (&quot;room&quot;);

  // First we make a primitive for our geometry.
  using namespace CS::Geometry;
  DensityTextureMapper mapper (0.3f);
  TesselatedBox box (csVector3 (-5, 0, -5), csVector3 (5, 20, 5));
  box.SetLevel (3);
  box.SetMapper (&amp;mapper);
  box.SetFlags (Primitives::CS_PRIMBOX_INSIDE);

  // Now we make a factory and a mesh at once.
  csRef&lt;iMeshWrapper&gt; walls = GeneralMeshBuilder::CreateFactoryAndMesh (
      engine, room, &quot;walls&quot;, &quot;walls_factory&quot;, &amp;box);
  walls-&gt;GetMeshObject ()-&gt;SetMaterialWrapper (tm);

  csRef&lt;iLight&gt; light;
  iLightList* ll = room-&gt;GetLights ();

  light = engine-&gt;CreateLight (0, csVector3 (-3, 5, 0), 10,
        csColor (1, 0, 0));
  ll-&gt;Add (light);

  light = engine-&gt;CreateLight (0, csVector3 (3, 5,  0), 10,
        csColor (0, 0, 1));
  ll-&gt;Add (light);

  light = engine-&gt;CreateLight (0, csVector3 (0, 5, -3), 10,
        csColor (0, 1, 0));
  ll-&gt;Add (light);
}
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>This extra code first loads a texture with <code>LoadTexture()</code>.
The first parameter is the name of the texture as it will be known in the
engine; and the second is the
actual filename on the <small>VFS</small> volume (see section <a href="VFS.html#0">Virtual File System (<small>VFS</small>)</a>). This function returns
a <samp>&lsquo;iTextureWrapper&rsquo;</samp> which we
don't use.  Instead we use the <samp>&lsquo;iMaterialWrapper&rsquo;</samp> which is created
automatically by <code>LoadTexture()</code>.
</p>
<p>The next block of code shows how to add a normal map to the texture we just
loaded.
</p>
<p>Then, we create our room with <code>CreateSector()</code>.  This room will initially
be empty.  A room in Crystal Space is represented by <samp>&lsquo;iSector&rsquo;</samp> which is
basically a container which can hold geometrical objects. Objects
in Crystal Space are represented by <em>mesh objects</em> (see section <a href="MeshObject.html#0">Mesh Object Plug-In System</a>).
There are several types of mesh objects in Crystal Space. Every type of
mesh object represents some different way to represent geometry. In this
tutorial we are only going to use the &ldquo;genmesh&rdquo; mesh object type. This mesh
object type is very useful for walls of indoor maps or buildings. Most mesh
objects don't contain any geometry. The geometry definition is actually
contained in the mesh factory. So that's why we first create a factory for
our walls.
</p>
<p>Now, we want to create the six walls of our room. For this the best object
to use is the GenMesh object (see section <a href="MeshObject-Genmesh.html#0">Genmesh Mesh Object</a>). With genmeshes
the geometry is represented in the factory. From that factory you can then
create multiple meshes. In our case we only need one mesh for the walls (which
will be a box visible from the inside). So we will create one factory and
one mesh from that factory.
</p>
<p>There is a <samp>&lsquo;CS::Geometry&rsquo;</samp> namespace where there are several conveniance
classes to help you build genmeshes. In our case we need a box that is visible
from the inside. We will use the <samp>&lsquo;TesselatedBox&rsquo;</samp> class for that purpose.
We use a tesselated box (as opposed to a normal box) so that our lighting is
more accurate. If you don't use lightmaps (like in this example) then genmeshes
are only lit at vertices of the model and lighting for the rest of the
surface is interpolated. So to get accurate lighting you need a model that
has sufficient vertices. We use a tesselation level so that every face has
16 vertices (3 times 3 quads or eighteen triangles for every face). You can
increase the value in the <code>TesselatedBox::SetLevel()</code> call even more to
get even better lighting resolution but that will increase the number of
triangles in the model too much and it is not needed in this simple example.
</p>
<p>From this primitive we can now create both the factory and the mesh at once
using the <code>GeneralMeshBuilder::CreateFactoryAndMesh()</code> method. In
the <samp>&lsquo;GeneralMeshBuilder&rsquo;</samp> class there are other methods that you can use
to create only factories or meshes but in our case we use the simple method
of creating both at once. Because we give it a pointer to our tesselated box
it will immediatelly populate the factory with the triangles and vertices
required for this box. The <code>CreateFactoryAndMesh()</code> method places the
object at the origin in the sector (i.e. <samp>&lsquo;0,0,0&rsquo;</samp>). If you want to change
that you have to use <code>iMeshWrapper::GetMovable()</code>. But in this example
the origin is fine.
</p>
<p>The last thing we have to do is to set a material to use for this mesh. You can
set a material both on the factory (in which case all objects that are created
from this factory will share it) or on the mesh. In this case we set it on the
mesh by using <code>SetMaterialWrapper()</code>.
</p>
<p>Finally, we create some lights in our room to make sure that we actually are
able to see the walls.  The interface <samp>&lsquo;iLight&rsquo;</samp> represents a light.
In this case we created some static lights which can not move and change
intensity.  We create three such lights
and add them to the room with <code>AddLight()</code>. Note that the list of lights
in a sector is represented by an object implementing <samp>&lsquo;iLightList&rsquo;</samp>. To
get this list you call <code>iSector::GetLights()</code>.
</p>
<p>When creating a light we use several parameters.
First we have the name of the light. This is not used
often and mostly you can set this to 0. The second parameter is
the location of the light in the world. Then follows a radius. The light will
not affect polygons which are outside the sphere described by the center of
the light and the radius.  The next parameter is the color of the light in
<small>RGB</small> format (&lt;1,1,1&gt; means white and &lt;0,0,0&gt; means black).
The last parameter indicates whether or not we want to have a pseudo-dynamic
light.  A pseudo-dynamic light still cannot move but it can change intensity.
There are some performance costs associated with pseudo-dynamic lights so
it is not enabled by default.
</p>
<p>The call to <code>Prepare()</code> prepares the engine for rendering your scene.  It
will prepare all textures and meshes.
</p>
<p>Using the <code>ShineLights()</code> function we generate static vertex lighting
for our dynamically created geometry. Most of the times Crystal Space applications
will probably load maps from disk and for that situation the lighting information
(vertex and lightmaps) should already be present as calculated by the <samp>&lsquo;lighter2&rsquo;</samp>
application. However, for dynamically generated geometry you can choose to either
use some kind of hardware assisted lighting (by using the <samp>&lsquo;unshadowed&rsquo;</samp>
render manager for example) or else you can use static lighting. <code>ShineLights()</code>
is a convenience function that has the same end result as if the objects were
lit using <samp>&lsquo;lighter2&rsquo;</samp> with vertex lighting.
</p>
<p>Ok, now we have created our room and properly initialized it.  If you
compile and run this application you would still see a black screen.  Why?
Because we have not created a camera through which you can view the room.
