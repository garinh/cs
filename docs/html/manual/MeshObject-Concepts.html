<h3 class="subsection"> 4.10.1 MeshObject Concepts </h3>

<p><em>Written by Jorrit Tyberghein,
<a href="mailto:jorrit.tyberghein@gmail.com">jorrit.tyberghein@gmail.com</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>In this section a general overview is given of the mesh object plug-in
system and several of the concepts are explained.
</p>
<a name="1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Mesh Object </h4>

<p>A <em>Mesh Object</em> is what this plug-in system is all about.  It is basically
a 3D object that the engine can render.  Every mesh object knows how to render
and light itself.  Mesh Objects don't control their own position in the engine
though.  The engine is responsible for doing that.  Mesh Object implementations
must implement the <small>SCF</small> interface <samp>&lsquo;iMeshObject&rsquo;</samp>.  Every visible mesh
object in the world will implement this interface. Note that from the
perspective of the engine you will always communicate with <samp>&lsquo;iMeshWrapper&rsquo;</samp>
instead of <samp>&lsquo;iMeshObject&rsquo;</samp>.
</p>
<p>Mesh Objects often also implement one or more additional type specific
interfaces to access the characteristics of that Mesh Object.  The engine
itself does not know about these interfaces.  It is the responsibility of the
application writer to correctly set up the characteristics of all Mesh Objects
that it uses.  These type specific interfaces are usually called
<samp>&lsquo;iSomethingState&rsquo;</samp> (replace <em>Something</em> with the appropriate name).
</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Mesh Object Factory </h4>

<p>A <em>Mesh Object Factory</em> is an object from which you can generate Mesh
Object instances.  The Mesh Objects generated from a Mesh Object Factory will
inherit some of the characteristics from this factory.  Exactly which
characteristics depend upon the Mesh Object Type (see below).  Roughly
speaking, there are three possibilities:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
For some types the factory is really empty and only serves as a stub to create
Mesh Object instances.  In that case you would only have to use one factory to
generate all your Mesh Objects of that type.

</li><li>
In other cases the factory contains default values for some characteristics
that are copied to all Mesh Objects created from that factory.  In that case
you can decide to use one factory and change the settings before creating new
instances.  Or (for convenience) you can create several factories with default
values that you use often and create Mesh Objects from the factory of choice.

</li><li>
In still other cases the factory actually contains the characteristics used by
all Mesh Objects created from it.  Changing the factory characteristics will
actually modify the characteristics for all Mesh Objects instantly.  In this
case you will have to use a separate factory for all Mesh Objects sharing the
same characteristics.
</li></ol>

<p>Which of the possibilities is selected by some Mesh Object type depends on the
type.  You'll have to look it up in the respective documentation for that type.
Mesh Object Factories implement the <small>SCF</small> interface
<samp>&lsquo;iMeshObjectFactory&rsquo;</samp>. Note that from the
perspective of the engine you will always communicate with
<samp>&lsquo;iMeshFactoryWrapper&rsquo;</samp> instead of <samp>&lsquo;iMeshObjectFactory&rsquo;</samp>.
</p>
<p>Mesh Object Factories often implement one or more additional type specific
interfaces to access the characteristics of that Mesh Object Factory.  The
engine itself does not know about these interfaces.  It is the responsibility
of the application writer to correctly set up the characteristics of all Mesh
Objects Factories that it uses.  These type specific interfaces are usually
called <samp>&lsquo;iSomethingFactoryState&rsquo;</samp> (replace <em>Something</em> with the
appropriate name).
</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Mesh Object Type </h4>

<p>The <em>Mesh Object Type</em> describes a specific kind of Mesh Object plug-in.
For example, Crystal Space supports several types of Mesh Objects: particle
system, ball, terrain, genmesh, etc.  The Mesh Object
Type corresponds directly to the plug-in itself.  It is the class' responsible
for creating all Mesh Object Factories.  Mesh Object Types implement the
<small>SCF</small> interface <samp>&lsquo;iMeshObjectType&rsquo;</samp>.
</p>
<p>Some Mesh Object Types implement the <small>SCF</small> interface <samp>&lsquo;iConfig&rsquo;</samp>.  In
this case, you can use this interface to query all run-time options that are
valid for that type.
</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Loaders </h4>

<p>In addition to the functionality for the Mesh Objects themselves, many Mesh
Object Types support two implementations of the <small>SCF</small> interface
<samp>&lsquo;iLoaderPlugin&rsquo;</samp>.  By implementing this, these plug-ins can be used
directly by the standard Crystal Space map file loader.  There is a loader for
the Mesh Object Factory and a loader for the Mesh Object itself.  The Mesh
Object plug-in itself doesn't know about these loader plug-ins.  In fact, you
can even write different loader plug-ins for the same Mesh Object Type if you
so desire.
</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Responsibilities </h4>

<p>As mentioned above Mesh Objects only know how to render themselves and how to
update lighting information.  The engine is responsible for deciding when to
draw and when to update.  So basically, the Mesh Objects control the <em>how</em>
while the engine controls the <em>when</em>.  This is not completely true,
though.  The Mesh Object implementation itself must do some parts of the
visibility testing on its own.  For example, far plane clipping, and testing if
the bounding box of the object is visible on screen are all the responsibility
of the Mesh Object (but it can use the engine for help on calculating these
things).
