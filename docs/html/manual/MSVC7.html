<h3 class="subsection"> 2.4.2 Microsoft Visual C++ 8 or 9 </h3>


<p>Originally written by Philip Wyett <a href="mailto:philwyett@gmx.com">philwyett@gmx.com</a>.

<em>Last updated September 2009.</em>
</p>
<p>In order to successfully compile the Crystal Space 3D Software Development Kit
(<small>SDK</small>), you will need a copy of <em>Microsoft Visual C++ 8 (<small>.NET 2005</small>)</em>
or <em>Microsoft Visual C++ 9 (<small>.NET 2008</small>)</em>. The <em>Express Editions</em> 
are perfectly suitable to compile Crystal Space (although some extra steps are required
for the Express Edition of <small>MSVC</small> 8 is, more below).
</p>
<a name="1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Getting Extra Help </h4>

<p>If you need help with Crystal Space and Visual C++ or just Crystal Space in
general.  You can subscribe and then post a message to the Crystal Space
mailing list.  To subscribe see the following site and fill in the form:
</p>
<p><a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crystal-main">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/crystal-main</a>
</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Required/Optional External Libraries and Software </h4>

<p>All the following libraries and Software Development Kits (<small>SDK</small>) unless
stated are not required.  However, if you choose not to install them, at
compile time you must follow the documented instructions of how to unload these
projects from the Crystal Space build process.
</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Platform <small>SDK</small> - required for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition </h4>

<p>All supported versions of Microsoft Visual C++ ship with a version of the
Platform <small>SDK</small> that suffices to compile Crystal Space, except the 
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, which requires a seperate setup of 
the Platform SDK. Follow these instructions exactly to set up the <small>PSDK</small>:
</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700755.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700755.aspx</a>
</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> cs-win32libs - Required </h4>

<p>Before you attempt to compile Crystal Space, you must download
and install the &ldquo;cs-win32libs&rdquo; archive.  This archive contains alot of the
third party header, pre-built libraries and dll files used by Crystal
Space, i.e. <tt>&lsquo;libz-cs.dll&rsquo;</tt>, <tt>&lsquo;libjpeg-cs.dll&rsquo;</tt>, <tt>&lsquo;libpng-cs.dll&rsquo;</tt>, 
etc. See <a href="External-Libraries.html#cs_002dwin32libs">cs-win32libs</a>.
</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the cs-win32libs package, execute the binary and
follow the setup instructions.  You may want to select &ldquo;VC typical&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Select Components&rdquo; screen. You can further adjust the selection of installed 
components depending on your actual set up (e.g. install MinGW-related 
components if you plan to also use CrystalSpace with MinGW/MSYS).
</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Python - Optional </h4>

<p>Crystal Space contains support for Python scripting and thus has projects
within it requires that Python be installed on your system.  Make sure you add
the Python <em>include</em> and <em>libs</em> directories to <small>MSVC</small> so that the
compiler can see those files.  If you wish to compile with Python support you
must install Python 2.2 or later, which can be obtained from:
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>
</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Compiling Crystal Space </h4>

<p>To compile Crystal Space, you'll have to perform the following steps.  If
anything doesn't work, see the Win32 <small>FAQ</small>, <a href="#MSVC8-FAQ">MSVC8 FAQ</a>.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Load <tt>&lsquo;CS\mk\msvcN\wkstypical.sln&rsquo;</tt>, where <samp>&lsquo;N&rsquo;</samp> must be replaced with
the version number of the MSVC version you use.

</li><li>
From the file menu select <em>Build-&gt;Build Solution</em>.  <em>Note</em>: If you
want to build a debuggable version of Crystal Space, you should select the
<em>Debug</em> build mode; otherwise select the <em>Release</em> build mode.  Do
not use the special-purpose <em>ExtensiveMemDebug</em> build mode.

</li><li>
After a while the compilation should finish.  The signal for a
successful build will be come in the form of the something similar to the
following:

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped
</pre></td></tr></table></li></ol>

<a name="7"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Running the Demonstration Applications </h4>

<p>The first app you should try is Walktest.  This program shows many of the
features of the 3D engine.  You can run it by starting it from the windows
explorer.  It should be at <tt>&lsquo;.../cs/walktest.exe&rsquo;</tt>.  Don't start it from
other locations or from within Visual Studio.  It won't find the required files
if you do.
</p>
<p>If you want to run a debug session, you first have to set the working
directory.  First select the project you wish to debug and setting it as the
startup project. Next open <em>Project-&gt;Properties-&gt;Debugging</em> and enter
the base <tt>&lsquo;CS\&rsquo;</tt> directory as the working directory for debug sessions
(for example, <tt>&lsquo;C:\CS\&rsquo;</tt>).  Be sure to to this for <em>Debug</em> and
<em>Release</em> builds.
</p>
<p>You can now continue with the next platform-independent step.  The remaining
Windows-specific sections are only important when you want to compile your own
application using Crystal Space.
</p>
<a name="8"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Structure of the Workspace </h4>

<p><em>Note</em>: If you find bugs in the <small>MSVC</small> project or workspace files
coming with Crystal Space, don't send fixes for these files to the developers.
These files are generated automatically, so your fixes would be useless.
Better, send a description of the bug to the mailing list.
</p>
<p>The Crystal Space workspace is divided into several projects.  They all exist
as separate project files (<tt>&lsquo;*.vcproj&rsquo;</tt>).  The projects are collected
together by workspaces <tt>&lsquo;*.sln&rsquo;</tt>.  A workspace will also ensure correct
linking between the various projects.  There are several workspaces to choose
from.  Most users should choose the <em>typical</em> workspace, but the others
are available for the adventurous.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>&lsquo;wkstypical.sln&rsquo;</tt> &mdash; Builds the typical modules needed by most users of
Crystal Space.

</li></ul>

<p>The workspace uses a prefix system for naming contained projects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>&lsquo;app&rsquo;</tt> &mdash; Prefixes application projects.
</li><li>
<tt>&lsquo;lib&rsquo;</tt> &mdash; Prefixes library projects.
</li><li>
<tt>&lsquo;plg&rsquo;</tt> &mdash; Prefixes plugin module projects.
</li><li>
<tt>&lsquo;grp&rsquo;</tt> &mdash; Prefixes psuedo-groups of related projects.
</li></ul>

<p>The <em>Libraries</em> are C++ libraries that you can link into your own
programs.  Some of these libraries are part of the core of Crystal Space.
Their output are <tt>&lsquo;.lib&rsquo;</tt> files.
</p>
<p>The <em>Plugins</em> are also programming libraries, but they use a special
mechanism called <small>SCF</small> as their interface to your program.  This separates
their interface from the internals of the library and thus allows dynamic
linking.  In fact, some of the <em>Libraries</em> also use <small>SCF</small>.  The rule
for the <small>MSVC</small> workspace is simple: The <em>Plugins</em> are projects that
build a dynamic library (<tt>&lsquo;.dll&rsquo;</tt>).  You can find more information in the
section of this manual dealing with plug-in modules.  See section <a href="SCF-Chapter.html#0">Plugins, Reference counting, Interfaces (<small>SCF</small>)</a>.
</p>
<p>The <em>Applications</em> are programs using some of these libraries, so they
produce <tt>&lsquo;.exe&rsquo;</tt> files.
</p>

<h4 class="subsubheading"> Compiling Your Own Program Using Crystal Space </h4>

<p>There is a <small>HOWTO</small> which explains how to create an <small>MSVC</small> project file
for your own program which utilizes Crystal Space.
See section <a href="HOWTO-Creating-External-MSVC-Application.html#0">Creating an External <small>MSVC</small> 7, 7.1, 8 or 9 Application</a>.
</p>
<a name="10"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Frequently Asked Questions (<small>FAQ</small>) </h4>
<p><a name="MSVC8-FAQ"></a>
</p>
<p>This is the list of frequently asked questions for the Win32 port of Crystal
Space.  Please consult this list if you are having difficulty building or using
the project.
</p>
<a name="11"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Building </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Q1. <em>I'm using the Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and I get a lot of 
&ldquo;file not found&rdquo; errors for <tt>&lsquo;windef.h&rsquo;</tt> and others. What is wrong?</em>

<p>Q2. <em>I'm using the Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and I get a lot of 
&ldquo;unresolved symbol&rdquo; errors for names like 
<code>SHGetSpecialFolderLocation@12</code>. What is wrong?</em>
</p>
<p>A. These errors indicate a lacking or an incomplete installation of the 
Platform SDK. Exactly follow the instructions given on Microsoft's 
&ldquo;Using Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition with the Microsoft Platform SDK&rdquo; 
page:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/</a>
Also, the instructions don't say that, but if you have Visual C++ open while 
applying those changes you need to restart it. 
</p>
</li><li> 
Q. <em>I get &quot;Errors in post link&quot; and later &quot;file not found&quot; errors.</em>

<p>A. Some problems with non-latin directory names have been reported (e.g.
Hebrew).  If your <tt>&lsquo;CS&rsquo;</tt> directory is under such a directory, try to move it
to a directory which name has only Latin characters in it.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>Where are the <tt>&lsquo;zlib.h&rsquo;</tt>, <tt>&lsquo;png.h&rsquo;</tt> and <tt>&lsquo;jpeglib.h&rsquo;</tt> files?</em>

<p>A. Those files are not part of the Crystal Space project, but they are
required to build it.  You must get a version of the following packages, most
of which can be easily found on the Internet.  You can download precompiled
versions of these libraries i.e. <em>cs-win32libs</em> or grab the source code and
compile it yourself if you prefer.  See section <a href="External-Libraries.html#0">External Libraries</a>.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>Where are the files <tt>&lsquo;libpng.lib&rsquo;</tt> and <tt>&lsquo;zlib.lib&rsquo;</tt>?</em>

<p>A. Just look above at the question about <tt>&lsquo;zlib.h&rsquo;</tt> and <tt>&lsquo;png.h&rsquo;</tt>.
It's the same problem, and if you have already done what is explained there,
I can't do much for you!
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>How can I reduce build times?</em>

<p>A. Build only the projects you will need. You must build all the Crystal Space
libraries, however those you may not need can be unloaded (Right click on the
project you wish unload from the build process and click on Unload). <em>Be
very careful when unloading projects as some of Crystal Spaces projects e.g.
some plugins are dependent on others</em>.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>How can I reduce build sizes?</em>

<p>A. Build only the projects you will need.
</p>
<p>A. Turning off precompiled headers tends to save a large amount of file space
while increasing build times somewhat.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>It seems that there is a missing source file in the project.</em>

<p>A. For Crystal Space the MSVC project files are generated once every 24 hours, 
so normally all missing sources should have been added after that time.  If 
you can't wait that long, or the file is still missing, contact one of the 
Crystal Space developers.
</p>
<p>For third party projects it's usually the best idea to contact one of it's
developers, they should be able to tell you which file is missing.
</p></li></ul>

<a name="12"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Executing </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Q. <em>I just get a black screen.</em>

<p>A. When I start <tt>&lsquo;walktest&rsquo;</tt> I just get a black screen, maybe with some
text output, but after a few seconds it drops back to the normal windows
screen without an error.
</p>
<p>This shouldn't happen any more, because in most cases now, <tt>&lsquo;walktest&rsquo;</tt> will
display proper error messages.  Anyway, you should make sure you have set an
appropriate directory set (see above).  Make sure you have specified the map
file in <tt>&lsquo;walktest.cfg&rsquo;</tt> as <samp>&lsquo;Walktest.Settings.WorldFile=&rsquo;</samp> (also keep
in mind, that your current directory is, where the executable sits.)
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>I get the following (or similar) errors:</em>

<table><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class="example">WARNING: could not load plugin
  `crystalspace.graphics3d.opengl'
WARNING: failed to initialize plugin
  `crystalspace.engine.3d'
FATAL: No iGraphics3D plug-in loaded!
FATAL: No iGraphics2D plug-in loaded!
Error initializing system!
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>A. You probably did not compile everything. Compiling only the <tt>&lsquo;.exe&rsquo;</tt>
file is not sufficient!  You must also compile all plug-ins you want to use.
In the above example the OpenGL renderer is missing.
</p>
<p>If you are certain that everything is compiled, make sure your working
directory is set to <tt>&lsquo;CS\&rsquo;</tt>.  To do this go to the <em>Project</em> menu.
Select <em>Settings</em> and go to the <em>Debug</em> tab.  Change the debug
executable to <tt>&lsquo;X:\CS\appname&rsquo;</tt> where <tt>&lsquo;X:&rsquo;</tt> is the drive letter where
the Crystal Space project is installed.  Next set the working directory to
<tt>&lsquo;X:\CS&rsquo;</tt>.  Click <small>OK</small> and you should be all set.
</p>
<p>If after doing this, you are still getting the same error, make sure that you 
have the <tt>&lsquo;libz-cs.dll&rsquo;</tt> installed, the <small>VFS</small> plugin is dependent upon it.
</p></li></ul>

<a name="13"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Miscellaneous </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Q. <em>My last update did compile, but now I got a new version from the
<small>SVN</small> repository and everything seems to be broken.</em>

<p>A. When working with Crystal Space, always keep in mind, that this is a
multiplatform project.  So sometimes not all features will work correct on all
platforms.  Sometimes a specific port may even be broken due to changes in
other ports.  Since the introduction of <small>SVN</small> (see <a href="Where-to-Get.html#SVN">SVN</a>) this is usually
only for a short time, so if you got your version out of <small>SVN</small>, it usually
pays off, to post a message describing the problems to the Crystal Space
Mailing List describing you problem and include the exact error messages.  If
you wait a while, this will probably be fixed, or at least be worked around.
See section <a href="Mailing-Lists.html#0">Mailing Lists</a>.
</p>
</li><li>
Q. <em>I have a problem that you haven't solved here!</em>

<p>A. Try sending a note to the Crystal Space mailing list and asking your
question there.  See section <a href="Mailing-Lists.html#0">Mailing Lists</a>.  Be sure to include any pertinent
information, such as the operating system you are using, the compiler, which
version of Crystal Space, and any special configuration information.
