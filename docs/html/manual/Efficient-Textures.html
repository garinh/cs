<h3 class="subsection"> 4.12.4 Efficient Textures </h3>

<p>This section contains information on how to create efficient textures and 
explains how to control aspects of texture rendering, like the format they are 
uploaded to the graphics hardware.
</p>
<a name="1"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading"> Texture dimensions </h4>
<p>3D hardware can render textures more efficiently if the 
dimensions are powers of two (abbreviated as &quot;PO2&quot;) (e.g. 256x256, 512x128...), 
to the extent that hardware and graphics APIs (e.g. OpenGL) require textures 
to have PO2 dimensions. So does CrystalSpace for all textures, 2D and 3D. 
While you can feed non-PO2 textures into CS, they will be resized internally 
to a PO2 size (e.g. 640x480 will become 512x512). The resizing isn't very good, 
though: the texture will end up looking rather ugly when rendered.
</p>
<p>Although most modern hardware supports non-PO2 textures, there is still 
hardware that doesn't, and non-PO2 textures have limitations (e.g. no 
mipmapping, no wrapping around on edges) on all but high-end (as of time of
this writing - e.g. NVidia GeForce 6800) hardware. 
</p>
<p>Bottom line: Use power-of-two sized textures.
</p>
<p>Another facet is what size actually to use; it all depends on the content, of 
course. Some points to consider:
</p><ul>
<li> The days were certain hardware was limited to 256x256 textures are long 
gone; nowadays, the limit is 2048x2048 or 4096x4096. Texture compression also 
allows for performant high-resolution textures; so use them.

</li><li> You can easily downsize a texture when you find it is too large in a case. 
Upsizing a texture you find looks ugly or too blurry won't help - you cannot 
get information that's just not there. Means, better start off with textures 
too large than textures too small.

</li><li> The OpenGL renderer allows user-configurable use of lower-resolution 
versions of textures through the <samp>&lsquo;Video.OpenGL.TextureDownsample&rsquo;</samp> 
configuration setting - so you don't need to worry that much about users with 
low video memory as they can get a performance increase by changing this 
setting to a value greater than 0.
</li></ul>

<h4 class="subsubheading"> Texture file format </h4>
<p>A texture has to be physically stored somewhere. CrystalSpace supports a 
number of image formats to load textures from, common ones such as <small>PNG</small>, 
<small>TGA</small>, <small>BMP</small>, <small>JPG</small>, <small>DDS</small>, <small>GIF</small>, and less common to exotic 
ones like <small>MNG</small> and <small>JNG</small>. 
</p>
<p>What format you want depends on considerations like whether you need an alpha 
channel or not, can accept lossy compression, and the disk space taken up. 
The color depth is pretty much unimportant, CS uses truecolor textures when 
rendering with OpenGL, so at runtime e.g. using paletted textures gains you exactly 
nothing over truecolor images.
</p>
<p>Alpha is supported by <small>PNG</small>, <small>TGA</small>, <small>BMP</small>, <small>DDS</small>, <small>MNG</small>, 
<small>JNG</small>, the compression is lossless for <small>PNG</small>, <small>GIF</small>, <small>TGA</small>, 
<small>BMP</small>, and can be lossless or lossy for <small>MNG</small> and <small>DDS</small>. <small>MNG</small> is
a bit special as it is an animation format and hence is usually used if you 
want animated textures.
</p>
<p>Commonly, <small>PNG</small>, <small>TGA</small> are used for textures with alpha and JPG for 
textures without. Those formats are commonly perceived as the best options,
as they cover the commonly needed features and offer decent compression.
However, the best format you can use is actually <small>DDS</small>.
</p>
<p>To determine why, take a look at what happens if e.g. a PNG texture is loaded 
into CS:
</p><ol>
<li> The texture is uncompressed.
</li><li> Mipmaps are created.
</li><li> The textures are uploaded to the hardware.
</li></ol>

<p>Unobviously, step 3 actually contains a recompression. That is due the fact 
that CrystalSpace uses texture compression (which has a positive effect 
performance-wise), but the texture data is sent to OpenGL in RGB(A) format, 
which means that the driver needs to compress the texture - this costs some 
time.
</p>
<p><small>DDS</small> offers an advantage here, as, in <small>DDS</small> files, 
</p><ul>
<li> image data can be stored in the same compression format(s) that hardware 
nowaday uses (<small>DXT1</small>, <small>DXT3</small>, <small>DXT5</small>) 
</li><li> the mipmaps of a texture can be stored. 
</li></ul>
<p>That means that the steps 1 and 2 above are basically not needed, and so is the 
recompression in step 3, as the data that needs to be uploaded is precompressed. 
Getting rid of all that processing greatly improves load time.
</p>
<p>Without alpha (<small>DXT1</small> compression), 4 bits per pixel are needed, with 
alpha (<small>DXT3</small>, <small>DXT5</small>), 8 bits per pixel are needed. That is before any 
zip compression, though; the gross file size of a <small>DDS</small> file can rival 
those of <small>PNG</small> and <small>JPG</small> files.
</p>
<p><small>DDS</small> files can be created with e.g. a Photoshop plugin to export DDS files 
which is available from NVidia 
(<a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_texture_tools.html">http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_texture_tools.html</a>) or GIMP 
<small>DDS</small> plugins which are also available on the web 
(<a href="http://nifelheim.dyndns.org/~cocidius/dds/">http://nifelheim.dyndns.org/~cocidius/dds/</a>). Last but not least, CS'
<small>DDS</small> plugin is also able to save <small>DDS</small> files, in conjunction with the
<tt>&lsquo;csimagetool&rsquo;</tt> app you can have a simple <small>DDS</small> converter.
</p>

<h4 class="subsubheading"> Texture quality control </h4>
<p>As mentioned above, textures in CS are compressed before being uploaded to the 
graphics hardware; while compressed textures are fast, they are sometimes 
undesirable (e.g. for normal maps - see 
<a href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/bump_map_compression.html">http://developer.nvidia.com/object/bump_map_compression.html</a> for an 
illustration of the problems). 
</p>
<p>CrystalSpace allows quality control here on a per-texture base through 
<em>texture classes</em>. Basically, a texture class is a collection of certain 
settings that control how a texture is uploaded to the graphics hardware. 
E.g. the <samp>&lsquo;lookup&rsquo;</samp>, <samp>&lsquo;normalmap&rsquo;</samp> and <samp>&lsquo;nocompress&rsquo;</samp> cause textures 
to be stored uncompressed on the hardware. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, texture classes also attach some &quot;semantics&quot; to textures - 
useful for tools or humans that read the raw world file. The class of a 
texture can be set by adding <code>&lt;class&gt;normalmap&lt;/class&gt;</code> or similar 
to the <code>&lt;texture&gt;</code> block.
