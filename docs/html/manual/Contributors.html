<h2 class="section"> 1.12 Crystal Space Contributors </h2>


<p>This is a list of people who have contributed to Crystal Space in one way or
another.  Some of these people are no longer active with Crystal Space and may
not be reachable.  This list is sorted alphabetically by first name.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Adam Bradley (<a href="mailto:artdodge@cs.bu.edu">artdodge@cs.bu.edu</a>)

<p>Adam worked a lot on the Crystal Space event system. He designed it completely
from scracth and then did all the needed implementation work.
</p>
</li><li>
Alessandro Russo (<a href="mailto:alessandro.russo@ntt.it">alessandro.russo@ntt.it</a>)

<p>Alessandro contributed a patch for the X11 driver which allows simultaneous
keypresses and disables autorepeat.  This makes movement much smoother.
</p>
</li><li>
Alex Pfaffe (<a href="mailto:ddg@oz.net">ddg@oz.net</a>)

<p>Alex integrated Crystal Space with the <small>VCOLLIDE</small> library for collision
detection.  Later he removed <small>VCOLLIDE</small> and used <small>RAPID</small> instead.  He
then rewrote <small>RAPID</small> to work better with Crystal Space.  He also contributed
the (long defunct) <small>DDG</small> landscape engine.
</p>
</li><li>
Anders Reggestad (<a href="mailto:anders@pvv.ntnu.no">anders@pvv.ntnu.no</a>)

<p>Anders fixed <code>csGetTicks()</code> to be multi-thread safe and also made sure it
does not overflow.
</p>
</li><li>
Anders Stenberg

<p>Anders added the <small>ODE</small> based dynamics plugin.  He also wrote the original
(and now obsolete) effect-system which was the first integration of more
advanced OpenGL features into Crystal Space.  Anders was also one of the
initiators and main contributors to the new advanced rendering system. He also
worked on the (now defunct) Pico<small>GUI</small> plugin.
</p>
</li><li>
Andon M. Coleman

<p>Andon patched 3ds2lev so it works correctly for non-texture mapped <small>3DS</small>
objects.
</p>
</li><li>

</p>
</li><li>
Brandon Ehle (<a href="mailto:azverkan@yahoo.com">azverkan@yahoo.com</a>)

<p>Brandon contributed the original csPython and csLua modules for scripting.
(The Python module has undergone complete re-write by Rene Jager since that
time, and the Lua module has been dropped for lack of maintenance.)  Using
csPython he wrote an Unreal map-to-Crystal Space convertor.  Brandon also
worked on the never completed (and long defunct) PlayStation2 port. He made
some improvements to <samp>&lsquo;csQuaternion&rsquo;</samp>.  He added the (now non-existant)
<tt>&lsquo;newdoc&rsquo;</tt> directory with LaTeX documentation (which was dropped in favor of
Texinfo). Later Brandon worked on a cal3d convertor for Crystal Space and a
motion manager plugin (both of which have been completely subsumed by more
recent and functional modules by other contributors).
</p>
</li><li>
Brendan Burns (<a href="mailto:bburns@genet.cs.umass.edu">bburns@genet.cs.umass.edu</a>)

<p>Brendan worked on a memory canvas which can render directly to a memory buffer
instead of a window.
</p>
</li><li>
Brett Hall (<a href="mailto:swizin@rain.org">swizin@rain.org</a>)

<p>Brett fixed a bug in the X11 canvas which caused it to crash at exit when the
window was closed by the window manager.
</p>
</li><li>

</p>
</li><li>
caedes (<a href="mailto:caedes@sindominio.net">caedes@sindominio.net</a>)

<p>caedes submitted the <samp>&lsquo;Jack&rsquo;</samp> sound renderer. caedes also worked
on the <samp>&lsquo;sprcal3d&rsquo;</samp> loader and he updated the scripting plugins for
various classes in CS. caedes also worked on the physics loader plugin and
the <small>ODE</small> physics plugin. caedes also added a new sequence to the
engine sequence manager.
</p>
</li><li>
Charles Al' Quarra (<a href="mailto:charsquarra@hotmail.com">charsquarra@hotmail.com</a>)

<p>Charles contributed the <small>OPCODE</small> and (the now obsolete) cloth plugins.

</li><li>
Christopher Nelson (<a href="mailto:paradox@BBHC.ORG">paradox@BBHC.ORG</a>)

<p>Christopher is the author and creator of the Alternate Windows System <small>AWS</small>
for Crystal Space.  He also added the (now defunct) cslexan (lexical analyzer)
plugin. Before he started work on the <small>AWS</small>, he contributed to
<small>CSWS</small>. Christopher also created the terrbig terrain plugin, and contributed
a platform independent memory mapper.
</p>
</li><li>
Conor Stokes (<a href="mailto:cstokes@wantree.com.au">cstokes@wantree.com.au</a>)

<p>Conor performed some optimization of the 16-bit scanline routines in the
software renderer following optimizations by Olivier Langlois.  He was also the
main inspiration source for the current visibility algorithm work done at that
time.
</p>
</li><li>
Dan Bogdanov

<p>Dan was the <small>DJGPP</small> port maintainer for a time.
</p>

Dan Ogles (<a href="mailto:dogles@peachtree.com">dogles@peachtree.com</a>)

<p>Dan provided a patch for <samp>&lsquo;printf()&rsquo;</samp> to make it work with the Windows port.
Dan made the Direct3D port for Windows. He greatly enhanced the Windows port
and also added 16-bit support for Windows.  He also spearheaded the (now
defunct) movement to make the 3D and 2D drivers <small>COM</small>-compliant, and
supplied a skeleton <small>COM</small> framework for non-Windows platforms.  He also
contributed the early halo code to Crystal Space.
</p>
</li><li>
Daniel Duhprey (<a href="mailto:duhprey@yahoo.com">duhprey@yahoo.com</a>)

<p>Daniel contributed the <samp>&lsquo;csOBB&rsquo;</samp> class (Oriented Bounding Box).  He also
made the terrbig plugin and helped develop the <small>ODE</small> dynamics plugin.  He
did a good deal of work on the new rendering system; especially the shadow
system. He also worked on the new terrain engine (for new renderer).
</p>
</li><li>
Daniel Fannar Gudbjartsson (<a href="mailto:dfg@decode.is">dfg@decode.is</a>)

</p>
</li><li>
Desmond Fletcher (<a href="mailto:desmond.fletcher@usm.edu">desmond.fletcher@usm.edu</a>)

<p>Desmond helped a bit on <tt>&lsquo;map2cs&rsquo;</tt> and updated its documentation.  He also
pointed out several bugs and errors in Crystal Space.
</p>
</li><li>
Darius Snapkauskas (<a href="mailto:snapkus@iname.com">snapkus@iname.com</a>)

<p>Darius was busy with 3D sprites.  He contributed some unfinished stubs for his
work.  Unfortunately he seemed to have stopped supporting it.  His unfinished
code was retired and replaced completely with an implementation by Jorrit.
</p>
</li><li>
David N. Arnold (<a href="mailto:derek_arnold@fuse.net">derek_arnold@fuse.net</a>)

<p>David enhanced the <small>DOS</small> port made by Murat.  He added C++ classes and
<small>VESA</small> support.  David also wrote the original Pentium assembler version of
<tt>&lsquo;scan.cpp&rsquo;</tt> in the software renderer.
</p>
</li><li>
David M. Asbell (<a href="mailto:dasbell@users.sourceforge.net">dasbell@users.sourceforge.net</a>)

to specific places on other sprites.
</p>
</li><li>
David Durant (<a href="mailto:ddurant@novametrix.com">ddurant@novametrix.com</a>)

<p>David added code for sprite selection to WalkTest and also applied some fixes
for sprites. He cleaned up some code in WalkTest, and added a double-linked
list class.
</p>
</li><li>
David Huen (<a href="mailto:smh1008@cus.cam.ac.uk">smh1008@cus.cam.ac.uk</a>)

<p>David did a some work to improve the original BeOS port.
</p>
</li><li>
Denis Dmitriev (<a href="mailto:mrsigma@home.com">mrsigma@home.com</a>)

<p>Denis contributed a routine to split a convex object into slices parallel to
the view plane (useful for volumetric fog).  He added a progress bar to the
console (during lighting) and added a new way to do bilinear filtering for the
software renderer.  He also dramatically improved the quality of the
precalculated lightmaps in the software renderer.  Denis improved the movement
system in WalkTest by implementing gravity and better collision detection
(using the collision detection system from Alex Pfaffe).  He added the
(defunct) metademo application which was later reworked to become the
<tt>&lsquo;metaballs&rsquo;</tt> mesh object.  He also fixed a number of bugs.
</p>
</li><li>
Doug Rabson (<a href="mailto:dfr@nlsystems.com">dfr@nlsystems.com</a>)

<p>Doug helped fixed a possible memory leak with <small>SHM</small> extension in the X11
driver.
</p>
</li><li>
Dmitry Derevyanko (<a href="mailto:dmitryd@robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu">dmitryd@robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu</a>)

<p>Dmitry helped by running Purify and solving numerous bugs that way.  He also
contributed (now defunct) makefiles for <small>IRIX</small>/<small>SGI</small>.
</p>
</li><li>
Eric Sunshine (<a href="mailto:sunshine@sunshineco.com">sunshine@sunshineco.com</a>)

<p>Eric is one of the developers who does far more work than can possibly be
detailed in this small blurb, and his contribution to Crystal Space is far
more extensive than this tiny entry implies. His contributions include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ported Crystal Space to MacOS/X, MacOS/X Server (Rhapsody), OpenStep, and
NextStep.

</li><li>
Is the designer, instigator, and (often) implementor of many of the sweeping
architectural changes to the project which have taken it from a monolithic and
inflexible Quake-<em>wannabe</em> to a well-designed, and well-thought-out,
modular, and extensible package aimed at a much wider audience. A small list of
such sweeping changes includes: Replacement of the monolithic <small>SCF</small>
registration database (<tt>&lsquo;scf.cfg&rsquo;</tt>) with a self-describing plugin facility;
eradication of the monolithic &ldquo;system driver&rdquo; class and related convolutioin
which prevented Crystal Space from acting as a component capable of being
<em>plugged into</em> a larger, existing application framework; creation of the
domain-based configuration facility which allows higher-priority components to
override settings of lower-priority components, and which maintains
user-specific settings separately from factory-supplied (read-only) settings
(the user-specific settings can roam with the user if supported by the
platform); the <samp>&lsquo;object registry&rsquo;</samp>, which is a general-purpose container
accessible to all components, and into which components can place any resources
they wish to share with other components; instigation of the event system
overhaul to take it from a monolithic, unalterable facility to a completely
extensible one in which any plugin module or custom application can define and
create new event types dynamically (without having to modify the Crystal Space
event definitions); and much more.

</li><li>
Fixed hordes upon hordes of bugs and problems throughout the project.

</li><li>
Provided significant updates and clean up to the build systems, source code,
organization, and architecture.

</li><li>
Added an automated synthesis process for the Windows/<small>MSVC</small> project files.
This process gleans necessary information from the <small>GNU</small> makefiles
throughout the project in order to entirely eliminate manual maintenance of
these files.

</li><li>
Added automated generation of <small>CVS</small> <samp>&lsquo;snapshots&rsquo;</samp>. These are packages
(archive files) containing the complete <small>CVS</small> tree. Also, log files and
<em>diff</em> files are generated.

</li><li>
Took on the task of acting as master editor of the Crystal Space documentation.
As part of this job, he has written much of the content which ties together
various portions of the manual, fleshed out much of the bare skeleton and
written many otherwise absent sections. He is also responsible for the
documentation's current look and feel and has created an entire supporting
infrastructure to make documentation available easily and automatically on all
supported platforms. He set up the automated <small>API</small> reference generation,
node repairing for the Texinfo documentation source, and conversion of Texinfo
to various other formats.  He has also pored through the documentation and
updated many out of date references.

</li><li>
Re-wrote and re-engineered the (now defunct) BeOS port of Crystal Space almost
entirely from scratch, in the process making it about 98% functional as
compared to being only about 15% functional before the re-write.

</li><li>
Re-engineered Crystal Space's network driver architecture and completely
rewrote the network drivers from scratch.  The new architecture is far more
robust, generalized, and usable than the old.

</li><li>
Coerced Crystal Space to use <small>GNU</small> Autoconf for configuration (or, looked at
another way, he coerced Autoconf to work with Crystal Space), and wrote all of
the underlying configuration support code (no small job).
</li></ul>

</li><li>
Eric Wigforss (<a href="mailto:ewigforss@novametrix.com">ewigforss@novametrix.com</a>)

<p>Eric applied a few Windows-specific patches to the networking code.
</p>
</li><li>
Erik Namtvedt

<p>Erik contributed the (now defunct) ensocket network plugin.
</p>
</li><li>
FragDance Galore (<a href="mailto:fragdance@hotmail.com">fragdance@hotmail.com</a>)

<p>FragDance contributed a <small>WAL</small>/<small>SGI</small> loader, and added initial support for
alpha maps to the texture loaders. He also contributed to the halo code.
</p>
</li><li>
Frank O'Connor (<a href="mailto:frank@oconnors.org">frank@oconnors.org</a>)

<p>Frank maintained the Windows port of Crystal Space for a while.  One of the
first tasks he undertook was a reorganization of the <small>MSVC</small> project
files. He also helped with project maintenance in general.
</p>
</li><li>
Frank Richter (<a href="mailto:res@crystalspace3d.org">res@crystalspace3d.org</a>)

<p>Frank has done too much to mention.  He has worked a great deal on many parts
of the project, making from minor to large-scale changes, ranging from the
build system, to the plugin system, to the renderer, to the engine.  He has
done a lot of work on the new renderer architecture, and has been a driving
force in improving localization and internationalization support.

Gary Clark (<a href="mailto:GaryC@jeld-wen.com">GaryC@jeld-wen.com</a>)

<p>Gary designed the basic framework of the <samp>&lsquo;Graphics3D&rsquo;</samp> class (which later
became <samp>&lsquo;csGraphics3D&rsquo;</samp>, and which later spawned the <samp>&lsquo;iGraphics3D&rsquo;</samp>
interface).  Gary also made an extension to optionally allow the use of
accurate <small>RGB</small> light sourcing in the software renderer. (It is optional
because it slows the texture cache.)  He also supplied a patch to fix the
problem with the X11 driver where it would not start drawing until an expose
event was generated.  He contributed the <tt>&lsquo;lin_joy.cpp&rsquo;</tt> file, which
provided an example of how to use the joystick from within
<small>GNU</small>/Linux. (This was never integrated into the project, however Norman
Kr&auml;mer much later provided a <small>GNU</small>/Linux joystick plugin which is part of
the project.)

M&aring;rten Svanfeldt (<a href="mailto:developer@svanfeldt.com">developer@svanfeldt.com</a>)

<p>Marten now as a Crystal Space Project Administrator has done far more work and
helped the project in so many ways, they are too numerous to completely
detail here.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Marten added support for vertex-programs to the old OpenGL renderer.

</li><li>
Marten was one of the initiators of the new advanced OpenGL renderer and
wrote large part of the interface.  He has written parts of the renderer
itself and the shader system.

</li><li>
Marten also worked on the new <small>SCF</small> system in Crystal Space
and he is the main author of the new lightmap system.

</li><li>
Marten has performed Crystal Space wide changes and additions that have
enhanced the codebase considerably.

</li><li>
Marten is a leading Crystal Space developer with the Microsoft <small>MSVC</small>
toolset and has been at the forefront of adding support for the latest
versions and maintaining compatibility with the Crystal Space codebase.

</li><li>
Recently Marten has been working on a new particles system for Crystal Space.
</li></ul>

</li><li>
Martin Geisse (<a href="mailto:mgeisse@gmx.net">mgeisse@gmx.net</a>)

<p>Martin converted many of the Crystal Space text and LaTeX documents to Texinfo
format.  He contributed a random dungeon generation plug-in module, as well as
a sample program which demonstrates its use. Martin added the model data
classes and rewrote the old model importer in a more modular way. He also
cleaned up some of the utility classes, parts of the (defunct) <em>system
driver</em> and parts of the engine, added the configuration manager which was
designed by Eric Sunshine, changed many applications to use the <samp>&lsquo;engine&rsquo;</samp>
as a plug-in (rather than linking it statically), and added the simplept
application. He added <samp>&lsquo;fast interfaces&rsquo;</samp> to <small>SCF</small>. Martin also
completely rewrote the <samp>&lsquo;Software&rsquo;</samp> and <samp>&lsquo;DirectSound&rsquo;</samp> sound
renderers, and modified the map file loader and the image loader to
work as plug-ins.
</p>
</li><li>
Matt Reda (<a href="mailto:mreda@mac.com">mreda@mac.com</a>)

<p>Matt contributed an OpenGL driver, a CoreGraphics driver, and a CoreAudio
driver for the MacOS/X port of Crystal Space.  The addition of these drivers

execute any function in another (main or non-main) thread. Using this system,
he modified the level loader (and related plugins) to be multi-threaded (scaling
to any number of threads). Other work done by him includes a SIMD framework - to
detect cpu support for such instructions at runtime, and fixes to many areas of
Crystal Space.

Nathaniel Saint Martin (<a href="mailto:noote@bigfoot.com">noote@bigfoot.com</a>)

<p>Nathaniel was an eager Crystal Space fan.  He even had his own web page (now
defunct) dedicated to Crystal Space.
</p>
<p>He enhanced Arnold's <small>DOS</small> port so that it worked with the Watcom C++
compiler.  He also suggested and implemented a restructuring of the
platform-dependent code with every port having its own directory.  He is also
the original author of the <samp>&lsquo;simpcon&rsquo;</samp> input/output console.  Nathaniel was
also the first to actually present Jorrit with an almost working Windows 95
version with source. Nathaniel is responsible for much of the early sound
support code in Crystal Space (mostly now rewritten).  He made the basic sound
system, wrote the Windows drivers and wrote support for 3D sound.  Nathaniel
created a Windows/<small>DOS</small> configuration utility which allowed easier editing
of <tt>&lsquo;cryst.cfg&rsquo;</tt> (an old-time configuration file).  In addition he also
enhanced the (now non-existant) <small>CSAR</small> utility.  He also helped develop the
Windows/Direct3D and Windows/OpenGL versions and is co-author of the (now
defunct) Glide port.  He made some enhancements to the 3D sprites including two
convertors from Quake <tt>&lsquo;.mdl&rsquo;</tt> and Quake 2 <tt>&lsquo;.md2&rsquo;</tt> to Crystal Space (now
combined into the single <tt>&lsquo;mdl2spr&rsquo;</tt> utility.

In particular he worked on the sound code, the engine, <small>CSWS</small> and the
graphics drivers.  He also worked on the image loaders.  For example he split
the former monolithic image loader into several modules, added write-support to
many of them, fixed the <small>BMP</small> loader to be endian correct and added
<small>RLE8</small> encoding to the <small>BMP</small> loader.  Norman also added the
<samp>&lsquo;csQuaternion&rsquo;</samp> class and updated the (now defunct) Glide drivers.  Norman
contributed a FreeType font server plug-in.  He added a grid-view to <small>CSWS</small>.
He also added a sound renderer using the <samp>&lsquo;artsd&rsquo;</samp> sound server that
comes with the <samp>&lsquo;aRts&rsquo;</samp> system (www.arts-project.org).  Norman added an
export script for Blender.  He added texture coordinate animation to 2D
sprites.  He worked on the video file streamer.  Norman also added the
(unused and removed) <samp>&lsquo;csCrystalBall&rsquo;</samp> culler and the fancy console plugin.
 In addition he also did a good deal of work on the OpenGL renderer
(mostly support for extensions).  Norman worked on <small>AWS</small> and created a
convertor from <small>QT</small> to <small>AWS</small>. Norman also added several sound related
