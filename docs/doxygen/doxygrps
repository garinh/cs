 * Doxygen group(aka "Module") definitions.
 * These are here, in their own file, rather than the includes because:
 *  a) Module names aren't sorted; so we can do that here
 *  b) It's easier to see what Modules there are and what identifiers they
 *     have.
 *  c) It's easier to change a description.
 *
 * Not much else interesting here.
