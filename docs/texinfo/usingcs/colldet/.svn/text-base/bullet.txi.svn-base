The @samp{bullet} plugin implements physics for Crystal Space using
the Bullet library (@url{http://www.bulletphysics.com/Bullet/}).

@subsubheading Doing the Timed Physics Simulation

To make sure the physics simulation proceeds correctly in time you must
tell Bullet how much time has elapsed since previous frame so that
it can calculate the collisions and physical interactions that happened
during that time. The @code{iDynamics->Step()} function is responsable for
that. As a parameter it has a delta which is a floating point number that
represents the number of seconds to calculate.
