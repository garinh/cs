@emph{@sc{scf} implementation revised by M@aa{}rten Svanfeldt and Michael Adams
2005-2006}

This library is intended for separating C++ class implementations from programs
that use them.  This is achieved by separating class implementations into a
separate module in the form of shared libraries, which are also called
@dfn{plugin modules}.  Separating the implementation of a class from the
program helps to address problems regarding shared library facility
incompatibilities on different platforms.  It also makes it possible to use
different mechanisms for @sc{scf}, for example inter-process communication
(through pipes, shared memory, or whatever); communication through network or
through a @sc{com} or @sc{corba} request broker; although currently only two
minimal configurations supported: using shared libraries and using static
linkage (for platforms that don't have shared library support).

There is a @sc{howto} which explains how to create a plugin module from the
ground up using @sc{scf} technology (@pxref{HOWTO Create Your Own Plugin}).
The @sc{howto} provides a much more concise explanation about how to create and
utilize a plugin than what you will find here, since this section is more
interested in exposing @sc{scf} in gory detail.  There is also a @sc{howto}
which explains how to make using @sc{scf} interfaces easier by using smart
pointers (@pxref{Smart Pointers}).

The @sc{scf} implementation is resides within the @file{CS/libs/csutil} module.

@subsubsection How it Works

This section contains technical details about @sc{scf}. If you're not
interested in details, you can skip directly to the next section which
explains how @sc{scf} should be used from the end-user's point of view.

@sc{scf} is somewhat similar to @sc{com}. This is because historically
Crystal Space initially used @sc{com} for inter-module communication. Thanks
to Dan Ogles for the initial implementation of a cross-platform @sc{com}
library; his implementation was a good test-bed for this @sc{scf}
implementation.

The differences between @sc{com} and @sc{scf} are due to the increased need for
an easier-to-use and more lightweight mechanism than @sc{com}.  The @sc{com}
implementation caused some problems (because of historic bugs in @sc{egcs}
1.1.x and incompatibilities with platforms to which Crystal Space has ported).
Also it has some problems due to the native Windows types used in @sc{com};
this experience was taken into account while developing @sc{scf}.

The main paradigm of @sc{scf}, as in @sc{com}/@sc{corba}/Java/etc. is the
@dfn{interface}.  You define an @emph{interface}, that is, a set of abstract
methods that you want to access within some object.  @sc{scf} interfaces are
plain C++ structs (or classes, it doesn't matter much except that if you're
using classes to which you will have to add the @samp{public:} keyword).
Theoretically, interfaces can contain member variables and inline methods
(though not non-virtual methods or constructors), @emph{but} this practice is
not encouraged because later someone may want to add a @sc{com}, @sc{corba},
etc.  layer between the client and the actual object, and this will not be
possible if the interfaces contains variables, inline methods, or non-virtual
methods.  If you don't plan to use @sc{com} or @sc{corba} later, then you can
use variables and inline functions as much as you like in your own code, but
their use in Crystal Space code is highly discouraged.

Here is an example of an interface in a file named @file{idog.h}:

@example
struct iDog
@{
  virtual bool IsAlive() = 0;
  virtual char const* GetName() = 0;
  virtual void SetName (char const*) = 0;
  virtual void Shout(int Volume) = 0;
  virtual void Run(int Speed, float Direction) = 0;
  virtual bool GetChildren(iObjVector* oBrood) = 0;
@};
@end example

Note the last method that gets a pointer of @samp{iObjVector} type.
@samp{iObjVector} is yet another interface.  We could pass a pointer to a
@samp{csObjVector} (the implementation of that interface) as well, but this
will mean both modules (caller and callee) should have same idea about what a
@samp{csObjVector} is, and if it happened that you compiled the shared library
with a slightly different version of @samp{csObjVector} (that, say, had one
member variable fewer) you will end up with a @sc{sigsegv} crash.  By instead
specifying the abstract @samp{iObjVector}, there is no need to link the
@samp{csObjVector} class into both the caller and the callee.

Now let's write a particular @dfn{implementation} of the above interface.

@example
#include "idog.h"

class MyDog : public iDog
@{
private:
  // private member functions & variables @dots{}
  csString Name;
public:
  virtual bool IsAlive();
  virtual char const* GetName();
  virtual void SetName(char const*);
  virtual void Shout(int Volume);
  virtual void Run(int Speed, float Direction);
  virtual bool GetChildren(iObjVector* oBrood);
  @r{@dots{} public member functions & variables @dots{}}
@};

bool MyDog::IsAlive()
@{
  return true;
@};

char const* MyDog::GetName()
@{
  return Name;
@}

void MyDog::SetName(char const* NewName)
@{
  Name = NewName;
@}

// And so on @dots{}
@end example

Now, we put the actual implementation into a separate module (i.e. into a
shared library), and include within the client just the interface file
@file{idog.h}. Since the client does not have any idea how we should build
an object of the @samp{MyDog} class, we also provide a function that will
return a newly-allocated object of that class. This is called the
@dfn{class factory} (in fact, a class factory is a bit more than just this,
but more about this later). Here is how to do it:

@example
static iDog* MyDog_Create()
@{
  return new MyDog();
@}
@end example

Okay, we did it. Now back to the client. To work with an object that
implements the @samp{iDog} interface we need to load the shared library, get
a pointer to the @code{MyDog_Create()} function, call it and get a new
@samp{MyDog} object. Further we work with this pointer as if it were pointing
to an @samp{iDog} object:

@example
csLibraryHandle handle = csLoadLibrary("./libdog.so");
iDog (*iDog_Create)() = csGetLibrarySymbol(handle, "MyDog_Create");
iDog* dog = iDog_Create();
printf("Doggy's name is %s\n", dog->GetName());
dog->Shout(100);
@dots{}
@end example

Of course, you don't have to do all this stuff manually with the @sc{scf}
implementation. The @sc{scf} library provides a number of useful templates and
functions which hide these ugly implementation details from end-user.

@node SCF Using, SCF Multiple Interfaces, SCF Explained, SCF
@subsubsection Using @sc{scf}

The only include header file you need to include to utilize @sc{scf}
functionality is @file{scf.h}.  It contains a number of macros and functions
that you will need for easier use of @sc{scf}.

Much basic functionality of @sc{scf} is provided by a central object.  It can
be accessed as @samp{iSCF::SCF} and is of type @samp{iSCF*} (which is also a
valid @sc{scf} interface).  This object is global and can be accessed from
@emph{anywhere}, even from dynamic libraries (plugin modules).  It is used by
several parts of @sc{scf}.  Note that this object is only available after
calling @code{scfInitialize()}, the main initialization function of @sc{scf}.
In typical use, however, you rarely need to interact directly with
@samp{iSCF::SCF}.  Instead, you invoke several convenient @sc{scf} macros which
interact with @samp{iSCF::SCF} on your behalf.

All @sc{scf} classes should be derived from the basic interface @samp{iBase}.
This interface declares the bare minimum set of methods which all @sc{scf}
classes should provide:

@table @code
@item void IncRef()
This function should be called each time you get a new reference to a object
and store it for a long-time usage.  Rather than invoking this method manually,
you can use a smart-pointer (@code{csRef<>}) to automate reference counting
(@pxref{Smart Pointers}).

@item void DecRef()
Call this function to decrement the object's reference count.  When the
reference count reaches zero, the object is deleted automatically.
There should be one matching @code{DecRef()} for each @code{IncRef()}
invocation.

@item void AddRefOwner(void**)
Call this function to set up a @dfn{weak reference} to the object .  A weak
reference is one which is invalidated automatically when the referenced object
is destroyed.  This is useful in cases when some object wants to hold a pointer
to an @sc{scf} object without actually owning a reference to the @sc{scf}
object.  Owning a reference prevents the @sc{scf} object from being destroyed,
whereas holding a weak reference merely says that you are interested in this
object as long as it is alive, but that you don't want to forcibly keep it
alive.  The argument to this method is a pointer to a variable which can hold a
pointer to an @sc{scf} object.  Rather than invoking this method manually, you
typically would use a weak-reference template to automate the reference
management (@file{CS/include/csutil/weakref.h}).

@item void RemoveRefOwner(void**)
Call this function to remove a weak reference to the object.

@item void* QueryInterface(scfInterfaceID InterfaceID, int Version); This
method will return a pointer to an interface. The @emph{Interface ID} is
synonymous to the name of the interface. You can get the @sc{id} of
an interface by invoking @code{scfInterfaceTraits<Interface>::GetID()}.
@end table

To simplify things even further, @file{scf.h} provides several templates that
provide default declarations and default implementations of these
methods. There is also the @code{SCF_IMPLEMENT_FACTORY()} macro which will
implement the factory function for your class which returns new instances of
the class to callers.

Example:

@example
// Abstract interface file (itest.h)
struct iTest : public virtual iBase
@{
  SCF_INTERFACE (iTest, 1, 0, 0);

  virtual void Foo () = 0;
@};

// Concrete implementation header (test.h)
class Test : public scfImplementation1<Test, iTest>
@{
public:
  Test (iBase* p = 0);
  virtual ~Test ();

  virtual void Foo ();
@};

// Concrete implementation source (test.cpp)
SCF_IMPLEMENT_FACTORY(Test)

Test::Test (iBase* p)
  : scfImplementationType (this, p)
@{
@}
Test::~Test ()
@{
@}

void Test::Foo ()
@{
  puts ("Foo");
@}
@end example

@node SCF Multiple Interfaces, SCF Interface and implementation inheritance, SCF Using, SCF
@subsubsection Classes Implementing Multiple Interfaces

Sometimes we will want one object to implement several interfaces.  For
example, the 3D graphics driver could provide a basic @samp{iGraphics3D}
interface and several additional optional interfaces such as @samp{iHalo},
@samp{iBumpMap}, and so on. This is done using special templates:

@example
class MyGraphics3D :
    public scfImplementation3<MyGraphics3D, iGraphics3D, iHalo, iBumpMap>
@{
public:
  @dots{}
@};
@end example

This is an example of a class implementing three interfaces. You need
to give the implementation of all functions from those three interfaces
in @samp{MyGraphics3D}.

@node SCF Interface and implementation inheritance, SCF Versions, SCF Multiple Interfaces, SCF
@subsubsection Interface and implementation inheritance

From time to time there might be a need or want for using normal inheritance
together with @sc{scf}. In practice there are two times you want to do this;
interface deriving from another interface to add methods and deriving from an
implementation class to add new interfaces.

In the first case where you want an interface to extend another, the declaration
of the interfaces is straight forward using normal C++ inheritance. However, to
make the implementation class aware of the base interfaces it should also expose
you need to use the @code{scfFakeInterface<>} template class in the parameter
to @code{scfImplementationN<>}.

Example:

@example
// Abstract interface file (itest2.h)
struct iTestBase : public virtual iBase
@{
  SCF_INTERFACE (iTestBase, 1, 0, 0);
  @dots{}
  virtual void SomeFunction () = 0;
@};

struct iTest2 : public iTestBase
@{
  SCF_INTERFACE (iTest2, 1, 0, 0);
  @dots{}
  virtual void NewFunction () = 0;
@};

// Concrete implementation header (test2.h)
class Test2 : public scfImplementation2<Test2, 
                                        scfFakeInterface<iTestBase>,
                                        iTest2>
@{
  @dots{}
@};

@end example

The other situation is when you want to take an already existing implementation
class, derive from it and add one or more new interfaces. Using only normal C++
inheritance and @code{scfImplementationN<>} like above is the right way to go if
the base class does not implement any @sc{scf} interfaces, if they do you need
to use the extra functionality that the template @code{scfImplementationExtN<>}.

@code{scfImplementationExtN<>} have same template parameters as 
@code{scfImplementationN<>} with one difference, the second parameter is the base
class to use. 

Example: Lets extend Test2 from above with one more interface

@example
struct iNewIf : public virtual iBase
@{
  SCF_INTERFACE (iNewIf, 1, 0, 0);
  virtual void PrintMe () = 0;
@}

class NewTest2 : public scfImplementationExt1<NewTest2, Test2, iNewIf>
@{
  @dots{}
  void PrintMe ();
@}

@end example



@node SCF Versions, SCF Client, SCF Interface and implementation inheritance, SCF
@subsubsection Interface Versions

Unlike @sc{com}, @sc{scf} supports interface versions.  That is, a shared class
could implement version 0.3.6 of given interface, and if client requests that
interface of a version lower or equal than 0.3.6, a correct interface pointer
is returned.  For this to work you need to define inside each interface header
file a specialization of the @code{scfInterface<>} template class for each
interface.  This specialization must provide the interface's version number as
the result of its @code{GetVersion()} method.  To correctly support different
versions of interfaces you should follow these guidelines:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Do not insert new methods into existing interfaces.  Instead, you should
append them after last defined method.

@item
If your change made the interface invalid for clients that expect older
versions of interfaces (for example, you broke the previous rule), increase
the major version number, and set minor and micro versions to zero.

@item
If your changes are relatively minor, but you do a major release, increase the
minor version number and drop the micro version to zero.

@item
If you are in the development process, and did a minor change to the
interface, increase the micro version.
@end itemize

The possible range for major and minor version numbers is 0..255, and the
range for micro version number is 0..65535.

When you query an interface, you should always tell it what interface version
are you looking for.  If a module cannot provide an interface compatible with
the requested version, then @code{QueryInterface()} will return @samp{NULL}
(same as if interface wasn't available at all).  You can use
@code{scfCompatibleVersion()} to check whether the requested version is
compatible with interface version. To specify the version of an interface
you can use the @code{SCF_INTERFACE()} macro.

@node SCF Client, SCF Meta Info, SCF Versions, SCF
@subsubsection Client Side

Now let's explain how to use all this mess from client side.  First, we should
be able to create objects that implement the interfaces we want.  For this, you
should use the @code{scfCreateInstance()} macro.  It receives two arguments:
the name of external class, and the name of the interface it implements.  So,
if we know class @samp{MyGraphics3D} implements the @samp{iGraphics3D}
interface, we can write:

@example
csRef<iGraphics3D> G3D = scfCreateInstance<iGraphics3D> ("MyGraphics3D");
if (!G3D)
@{
  fprintf(stderr,
    "Failed to create an instance of iGraphics3D!\n");
  abort();
@}
@end example

Now you can use the object any way you like, just like standard C++:

@example
G3D->BeginDraw();
G3D->DrawLine(@dots{});
G3D->DrawPolygon(@dots{});
G3D->EndDraw();
@end example

When you are done using the @samp{G3D} pointer (say, when program exits), the
reference you own for the object should be released.  This happens
automatically when the @code{csRef<>} goes out of scope.  If you are not using
@code{csRef<>}, but are instead using a plain pointer, @samp{iGraphics3D*},
then you must manually release the reference when you are done with it by
calling @code{G3D->DecRef()}.  After this you can not use @samp{G3D} anymore;
you should create another instance of @samp{iGraphics3D} if needed.

To query an object to see if it implements an interface, you should use the
@code{scfQueryInterface} macro. It also receives two arguments, first being
the object you are querying for the embedded interface, and second being the
name of the interface you desire. Example:

@example
csRef<iHalo> halo = scfQueryInterface<iHalo> (G3D);
if (!halo)
@{
  fprintf(stderr,
    "3D graphic driver doesn't support halos!\n");
  return;
@}
@end example

@node SCF Meta Info, SCF Meta Info Embedding, SCF Client, SCF
@subsubsection Plugin Meta-Information

It is possible and common to use @sc{scf} interfaces and objects directly via
the C++ class names, via creation functions, or via facilities which return
pointers to pure @sc{scf} interfaces.  However, when an external plugin modules
publishes a class implementing an @sc{scf} interface, the client of that plugin
can not access the object directly via C++.  This is where the @sc{scf}
@dfn{class name} comes into play.  An @sc{scf} class name is an abitrary string
assigned to the implementation.  The string is passed to
@code{scfCreateInstance()} in order to create an instance of the named
object.  If necessary, @sc{scf} will load the plugin which implements the named
object in order to satisfy the request.  The @sc{scf} class name can be
anything you like, though it is often useful to impose a hierarchical
interpretation on the name.  For instance,
@samp{crystalspace.graphics3d.opengl}.

The data which describes a plugin module, such as the @sc{scf} class names
and C++ implementations which the plugin exports, is known as
@dfn{meta-information}.  Each plugin has an associated meta-information
resource which describes the plugin module.  This information can be accessed
without even loading the plugin module.  At development time, the
meta-information is maintained in an @sc{xml}-format text file which has
the same name as the plugin module, but with extension @file{.csplugin}.  Here
is a sample meta-information resource for a plugin named @file{myplugin}
(@file{myplugin.so} on Unix, @file{myplugin.dll} on Windows):

@example
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- myplugin.csplugin -->
<plugin>
  <scf>
    <classes>
      <class>
        <name>myproj.myplugin.foo1</name>
        <implementation>MyClass1</implementation>
        <description>My first custom foo class</description>
      </class>
      <class>
        <name>myproj.myplugin.foo2</name>
        <implementation>MyClass2</implementation>
        <description>My second custom foo class</description>
        <requires>
          <class>myproj.myplugin.bar1</class>
          <class>myproj.myplugin.bar2</class>
        </requires>
      </class>
    </classes>
  </scf>
</plugin>
@end example

The top-level node of a meta-information file is named @code{<plugin>}.  All
@sc{scf}-related information is contained within an @code{<scf>} child node.
Plugin modules can export multiple named @sc{scf} classes.  Each exported class
is represented by a @code{<class>} node within the @code{<classes>} group.  The
@code{<name>} node of a @code{<class>} is the class' @sc{scf} name.  The
@code{<implementation>} node references the C++ class which actually implements
the named @sc{scf} class.  This is the same name that is privided as an
argument to the @code{SCF_IMPLEMENT_FACTORY()} macro.  When an @sc{scf} class
depends upon other @sc{scf} classes, the dependencies are indicated via the
optional @code{<requires>} group, which contains one @code{<class>} node per
dependency.

The above example meta-information resource indicates that the plugin exports
two C++ classes, @samp{MyClass1} and @samp{MyClass2} under the @sc{scf} class
names @samp{myproj.myplugin.foo1} and @samp{myproj.myplugin.foo2},
respectively.  Furthermore, the second exported class has a dependency upon two
other @sc{scf} classes, @samp{myproj.myplugin.bar1} and
@samp{myproj.myplugin.bar2}.  @sc{scf} will ensure that these other classes are
loaded before it instantiates @samp{MyClass2}.

Meta-information in the @file{.csplugin} file is extensible; it is not
restricted to @sc{scf}-only usage.  Plugin authors can choose to publish
supplementary information about plugins in addition to the @sc{scf} information
already published.  As a hypothetical example, image loading plugins might
desire to publish @dfn{image indentification} information which would allow the
image loading multiplexor to selectively request image loading plugins
@emph{on-demand}, rather than requesting all plugins unconditionally, even if
they are not needed.  Here is a possible meta-information table for a @sc{png}
image loader (with the @code{<scf>} node collapsed to @samp{@dots{}} for the
sake of illustration):

@example
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- cspngimg.csplugin -->
<plugin>
  <scf>...</scf>
  <imageloader>
    <imagetype>
      <class>crystalspace.graphic.image.io.png</class>
      <identify>
        <mimetype>image/png</mimetype>
        <extension>png</extension>
        <extension>PNG</extension>
        <scan length="4" bytes="\0x89PNG"/>
     </identify>
    </imagetype>
  </imageloader>
</plugin>
@end example

In this example, the @sc{png} loader meta-information tells the multiplexor
several different ways to identify a @sc{png} image:

@itemize @bullet
@item
By checking @sc{mime} type, if available.
@item
By checking file extension, if available.
@item
By checking for the @dfn{magic} identification string @samp{\0x89PNG} in the
raw image data.
@end itemize

@noindent
If the multiplexor identifies the image as @sc{png}, only then will it actually
request the @sc{png} loader plugin.

@node SCF Meta Info Embedding, SCF Plugin Discovery, SCF Meta Info, SCF
@subsubsection Meta-Information Embedding

The Crystal Space @file{configure} script option
@samp{--enable-meta-info-embedding} controls whether or not the build system
embeds the plugin meta-information into plugin modules (if supported by the
platform), and whether or not the plugin loader looks for embedded
meta-information.  If this option is disabled, or if embedding is not supported
by the platform, then the meta-information is laid down alongside the built
plugin module (@file{.so} or @file{.dll}) in a text file with the same name as
the plugin module, except with extension @file{.csplugin}.  The
meta-information embedding option is enabled, by default.

The platform-specific plugin loaders are capable of reading plugin
meta-information when it is embedded and when it exists in a stand-alone
@file{.csplugin} resource.  Even when configured for embedding, the plugin
loaders will still be able to recognize and utilize external @file{.csplugin}
resource.  This means that Crystal Space-based projects with unsophisticated
build systems, which are incapable of embedding meta-information into the
plugin module, can still create usable plugins by simply placing a copy of the
@file{.csplugin} file alongside the plugin executable (@file{.so} or
@file{.dll}).

External projects which are based upon Crystal Space's Jam build system
(@file{CS/mk/jam}) inherit, for free, the capability of embedding
meta-information within plugin modules (if supported by the platform).  Simply
grab the newer @file{.jam} files from @file{CS/mk/jam}, and add a few
definitions to the project's @file{Jamconfig} file.  The exact set of
definitions is platform-specific, so consult the appropriate Jam file
(@file{unix.jam}, @file{win32.jam}, or @file{macosx.jam}) to determine
precisely which which definitions are required.  Here is a list of definitions
required at the time of writing:

@table @asis
@item Unix
@code{EMBED_META = yes}@*
@code{LIBBFD.AVAILABLE = yes}@*
@code{OBJCOPY.AVAILABLE = yes}@*
@code{CMD.OBJCOPY = objcopy}

@item Windows
@code{EMBED_META = yes}

@item MacOS/X
@code{EMBED_META = yes}
@end table

@node SCF Plugin Discovery, SCF Example, SCF Meta Info Embedding, SCF
@subsubsection Plugin Discovery

At program launch time, @sc{scf} discovers plugins automatically by searching a
set of directories, and creates an internal database associating available
@sc{scf} class names with the plugin modules which implement them.  The
directories which @sc{scf} searches by default are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The application resource directory as returned by @code{csGetResourceDir()}.
On most platforms, this is the same as the directory containing the
application, however, on MacOS/X, it is the @file{Resources} directory within
the Cocoa application wrapper.

@item
The directory containing the application (or containing the Cocoa application
wrapper for MacOS/X) as returned by @code{csGetAppDir()}.

@item
The installed Crystal Space resource directories as returned by
@code{csGetConfigPath()}.  This is often the value of the @samp{CRYSTAL}
environment variable, or the @samp{CrystalSpaceRoot} default setting on MacOS/X
(which is often stored within the @samp{NSGlobalDomain} domain).
@end itemize

If you would like @sc{scf} to scan additional directories, you can invoke
either of these two functions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{scfInitialize (csPluginPaths const*)}
@item
@code{iSCF::ScanPluginsPath(char const*, bool, char const*)}
@end itemize

Finally, if need to manually register a single plugin module with @sc{scf} for
which you know the native pathname (not a @sc{vfs} pathname), you can invoke
@code{iSCF::RegisterPlugin()}.

@subsubsection Example

Here is a complete working example. It implements a shared class that has a
base and an embedded interface.

These are the interface files for the @samp{iDog} interface (the base
interface of our class) and the @samp{iName} interface (the interface
embedded into our class).

@noindent
@emph{File}: @file{idog.h}

  SCF_INTERFACE(iDog, 0, 0, 1);
  virtual void Walk() = 0;
  virtual void Shout(char const* Message) = 0;
@};
@end example

@noindent
@emph{File}: @file{iname.h}

@example
#include "csutil/scf.h"

struct iName : public virtual iBase
@{
  SCF_INTERFACE(iName, 0, 0, 1);
  virtual char const* GetName() = 0;
  virtual void SetName(char const*) = 0;
@};
@end example

Now here is the implementation of a class for both of the mentioned
interfaces:

@noindent
@emph{File}: @file{dog.cpp}

@example
#include "crystalspace.h"
#include "idog.h"
#include "iname.h"

class csDog : public scfImplementation2<csDog,iDog,iName>
@{
private:
  csString Name;

public:
  csDog(iBase* Parent);
  virtual ~csDog();

  // From iDog.
  virtual void Walk();
  virtual void Shout(char const*);

  // From iName.
  virtual char const* GetName();
  virtual void SetName(char const*);
@};

//---------- Implementation ---------

SCF_IMPLEMENT_FACTORY(csDog)

csDog::csDog(iBase* Parent) : scfImplementationType (this, Parent),
  Name ("<noname>")
@{
@}

csDog::~csDog()
@{
@}

void csDog::Walk()
@{
  printf("%s: I'm walking\n", Name.GetData());
@}

void csDog::Shout(char const* Message)
@{
  printf("I'm %s: shout, shout, %s\n", Name.GetData(), Message);
@}

// iName interface for dog.

char const* csDog::GetName()
@{
  return Name;
@}

void csDog::SetName(char const* NewName)
@{
  Name = NewName != 0 ? NewName : "";
@}

@end example

Since this is a plugin module, it requires a meta-information resource.
Here is the meta-information for the example plugin:

@noindent
@emph{File}: @file{dog.csplugin}

@example
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!-- dog.csplugin -->
<plugin>
  <scf>
    <classes>
      <class>
        <name>dog</name>
        <implementation>csDog</implementation>
        <description>A rather unusual dog</description>
      </class>
    </classes>
  </scf>
</plugin>
@end example

The above files should be built to get a plugin module named @file{dog.so}
(Unix) or @file{dog.dll} (Windows).  The plugin module will export the
@code{csDog_Create()} function which is implemented by the
@code{SCF_IMPLEMENT_FACTORY()} macro, and it will publish the meta-information
contained in @file{dog.csplugin}.

Finally, here is the source code for a simple client application that uses the
@samp{csDog} plugin.

@noindent
@emph{File}: @file{doggy.cpp}

@example
#include <stdio.h>

#include "cssysdef.h"
#include "csutil/scf.h"
#include "csutil/cfgfile.h"
#include "idog.h"
#include "iname.h"

static void test_dog()
@{
  csRef<iDog> dog = scfCreateInstance<iDog> ("csDog");
  if (!dog)
    fprintf(stderr, "No csDog shared class!\n");
  else
  @{
    csRef<iName> name = scfQueryInterface<iName> (dog);
    if (!name)
      fprintf(stderr,
        "Dog does not support iName interface!\n");
    else
    @{
      name->SetName("Droopy");
      dog->Walk();
      dog->Shout("hello!");
      printf("Dog's name is %s\n", name->GetName());
    @}
  @}
@}

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
@{
  scfInitialize(argc, argv);
  test_dog();
  iSCF::SCF->Finish();
@}
@end example

@subsubsection Advanced Techniques

The @sc{scf} library implements some things that you will need to know about
to use some advanced techniques.  They are described in detail, below.

@subsubheading Dynamic Class Registration

You can register and deregister @sc{scf} classes at run time.  There are times
when you would like to provide a named @sc{scf} class in your main application,
rather than in a plugin module.  In this case, you will need to manually
register the class with @sc{scf} since it will not be discovered by the
automatic scan for plugins.  To do this, the following method is provided:

@example
bool iSCF::RegisterClass (
  scfFactoryFunc,
  char const* ClassName,
  char const* Description,
  char const* Dependencies,
  char const* context);
@end example

Rather than having to remember to call this method from your code, you can
automate the registration by instead using the
@code{SCF_REGISTER_STATIC_CLASS()} macro, which takes the following arguments:

@example
SCF_REGISTER_STATIC_CLASS(
  C++Class,
  "scf.class.name",
  "description",
  "comma-separated dependency list" or NULL)
@end example

@noindent
This macro should be used at the top-level of the source file, outside of
any function.

If a class resides in a plugin module which was not discovered by the startup
scan, and if you do not elect to have @sc{scf} scan for the plugin with
@code{iSCF::ScanPluginsPath()} or an additional call to @code{scfInitialize()},
then you can manually tell @sc{scf} all about the class with the following
method:

@example
bool iSCF:RegisterClass (
  char const* ClassName,
  char const* PluginPath,
  char const* FactoryClass,
  char const* Description,
  char const* Dependencies,
  char const* context);
@end example

You can deregister a registered class with the following function:

@example
bool iSCF::UnregisterClass(char const* ClassIName)
@end example

@subsubheading Non-Registered Classes

Often, you do not need or want to register a class with the @sc{scf} kernel.
That is, you create your objects manually, using @samp{new} or some other
method and return them to callers of your functions as pure @sc{scf}
interfaces.  This is a perfectly valid use of @sc{scf} classes, and is often
employed.  It is common, for instance, for a named, published @sc{scf} class to
vend unnamed classes to callers of its methods.  These classes are often helper
classes.  In this case the unnamed object is not a part of the class registry.

@subsubheading Non-Parented Classes

Often, classes do not need to be parented.  This is frequently true of classes
which are not named and part of the class registry, as noted above.  In this
case your object is not a part of the class tree (see above) and thus does not
have a parent.  To implement such a class, you simply don't pass a parent
to @code{scfImplementationType()}.
