@section Documentation Authors & Contributors

Documentation for the Crystal Space project has been written and edited by
numerous volunteers.  This section pays tribute to both the major
documentation contributors as well as the minor ones.  In cases where a
section or chapter has been wholly authored or extensively edited by a single
individual, notice of that contribution is included as part of the section or
chapter itself.

The following people have made significant contributions to the Crystal Space
documentation by authoring large portions of this manual, often with entire
chapters or sections to their name.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Jorrit Tyberghein (@email{jorrit.tyberghein@@gmail.com})

As the creator of Crystal Space, Jorrit wrote the original documentation
included with the package.  Although some of that original work has since been
superceded by more recent work by himself and others, much of his writing can
still be found in this document.  In particular, he has authored several
sections which detail inner workings of the 3D engine as well as sections
which describe the theory behind the engine.

@item
Andrew Zabolotny (@email{bit@@eltech.ru})

Andrew has contributed several sections to this manual which document the
various large-scale contributions which he has made to the project.  They
include the @sc{scf} and @sc{vfs} systems, @sc{csws}, MazeD, memory debugger,
makefiles, and detailed information pertaining to the @sc{os/2} port.

@item
Eric Sunshine (@email{sunshine@@sunshineco.com})

In addition to writing several documents describing various ports of Crystal
Space in detail, Eric took on the task of acting as master editor of this
manual.  As part of this job, he has written much of the content which ties
together the various portions of the manual, fleshed out much of the bare
skeleton, written many otherwise absent sections, and performed the extensive
mathematical typesetting found throughout the manual.  His editing efforts
have been very extensive, and he is responsible for the manual's current
organization, look, and feel.  He also created several utilities and Texinfo
extension packages which allow the documentation to build cleanly on all
platforms supported by Crystal Space.

@item
Frank Richter (@email{res@@crystalspace3d.org})

Frank has written much @sc{api} documentation, as well as having contributed
material to the Crystal Space manual.

The following list of people have contributed to the Crystal Space
documentation effort in various ways over time.  In some cases their work has
become obsolete or has been superceded by more recent work and is, therefore,
absent from this manual, but we thank them anyhow.  This list is ordered
alphabetically by surname.

user manual and spotted and corrected a large number of typographical problems.

@item
Brandon Ehle (@email{azverkan@@yahoo.com})

Brandon initiated the aborted attempt to convert Crystal Space documentation
to LaTeX.  As part of this task, he made an initial effort to organize the

and @sc{html}.  The attempted LaTeX conversion predates the current manual
which is maintained in Texinfo format.

provided a more organized entry-point to the old text-based documentation
by creating an easily navigated @sc{html} cover page.

@item
Martin Geisse (@email{Hellwig.Geisse@@mni.fh-giessen.de})
