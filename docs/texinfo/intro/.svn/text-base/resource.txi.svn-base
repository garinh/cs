The Crystal Space home page contains the latest development and
official releases of Crystal Space.  Here is a small note about the
difference between the official and the development (beta) releases: both
the official and development versions are actually beta.  The difference is
that the official release should be more stable and will be easier to get
working as all documentation and makefiles are up-to-date.  The development
release will probably have more features but it may not work very well on
your particular system, it may not work at all, or you might not be able to
compile it.  But the development release may also work very well.  You never
know.

Crystal Space is being actively developed.  You can download
@emph{bleeding-edge} versions of the project from the @sc{svn} repository
where the absolute latest copy is stored.  There are two ways to access the
developmental version of the project.

First, you can access the @sc{svn} repository directly via a @sc{svn} tool.
Instructions for doing so may be found here:

@uref{http://crystalspace3d.org/main/Subversion}

Second, you can download a snapshot of the @sc{svn} repository using @sc{http}.
Snapshots are generated daily and are accompanied by standard @samp{diff}-style
@dfn{patch} files.

@uref{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/cvs-snapshots/}

You can also view the contents of the @sc{svn} repository online including
all of the historical information.

Documentation is included with the Crystal Space distribution.  A gateway to
all documentation can be found in the file @file{CS/docs/README.html}.  You can
read the local copy of the @cite{Crystal Space User's Manual} with your
web browser by loading the file @file{CS/docs/html/manual/index.html}, or the
@cite{Crystal Space Public API Reference Manual} by viewing the file 
@file{CS/docs/html/api/index.html}.

Documentation is available for online viewing.  The @cite{Crystal Space
User's Manual} is available for online viewing at this location:

@url{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/docs/online/manual/}

The @cite{Public @sc{api} Reference Manual} is available for online viewing
here:

@url{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/docs/online/api/}

In addition, all of the above documents may be downloaded for offline viewing
from the following location.

@url{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/docs/download/}

@noindent
The downloadable documentation may be available in a number of formats.  At the
very least, it will be available as @sc{html}.

Developers can generate their own copies of these manuals from the
Crystal Space source package by invoking certain makefile targets.  The
@cite{Crystal Space Manual} can be converted to various output formats
by invoking any of the targets @samp{manualhtml}, @samp{manualps},
@samp{manualpdf}, and @samp{manualinfo}.

The @cite{Public @sc{api} Reference Manual} and @cite{Developer's API
Reference Manual} can be converted to @sc{html} format by invoking the
@samp{apihtml} and @samp{apidevhtml} makefile targets, respectively.

These makefile targets place the generated output in appropriately named
subdirectories of @file{$@{builddir@}/out/docs}.

The Crystal Space developers are often available online for live chat via the
Internet Relay Chat (@sc{irc}) system.  If you are unfamiliar with @sc{irc}, a
good place to learn about it is @uref{http://irchelp.org/}.  The Crystal
Space developers inhabit a channel named @code{#CrystalSpace} on the FreeNode
Network. You can find more information about FreeNode at
@uref{http://freenode.net/}, including a list of servers. There are a few
redirection servers to which you should be able to connect right away. Try
connecting to one located closest (geographically) to you for the least lag.

@example
irc.au.freenode.net
irc.cn.freenode.net
irc.eu.freenode.net
