@cindex Introduction

CrystalSpace is a portable modular 3D @sc{sdk}, including many components
for building various applications and games - these are still quite
useful for projects that do not involve 3D. @sc{cs} is still very much in 
development, so anyone who feels inclined to do so can contribute to the
source. There are a number of incomplete components still needing to be 
finished, and a wide array of possibilities for new contributions; for
more information about what is missing and a list of currently known
bugs, please visit the Developer's Project page at SourceForge:

@sc{gnu} copyleft license for libraries @sc{lgpl}.  A copy of the @sc{lgpl}
is included in this manual for your perusal (@pxref{Licenses}). In short, the
@sc{lgpl} allows you to use CrystalSpace as a library in your products, even 
commercial products, but modifications to the library or derivative
works incorporating parts of the library must be made freely available
to everyone, under the @sc{lgpl}'s terms.

Please read the @sc{faq} if you have any questions.  If you don't find the
answer there you can always email the mailing lists. @xref{FAQ}, or
