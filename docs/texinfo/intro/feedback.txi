@cindex Bug Reporting

If you find a bug in Crystal Space there are two ways to report it to the
developers. The preferred method of reporting bugs is to use the Crystal Space
bug tracker:

@noindent
@uref{http://trac.crystalspace3d.org/trac/CS/}

Additionally, you can send a message to the main Crystal Space mailing list
(@pxref{Mailing Lists}) at @email{crystal-main@@lists.sourceforge.net}.

@noindent
Try to give as much information as possible about the bug, including:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Crystal Space version number. If it is a @sc{svn} snapshot then include
the time that you downloaded it. If you are using @sc{svn} directly then
state the revision of your working copy.
@item
Operating System (Windows (@emph{95, 98/@sc{se}/@sc{me}, @sc{nt}4, 2000,
@sc{xp}}), MacOS/X, Unix --- @sc{gnu}/Linux, Free@sc{bsd}, etc.  --- @dots{}).
@item
The compiler that you used (@sc{gcc}, Mingw, @sc{msvc}, @dots{}).
@item
Architecture (Intel x86, @sc{amd} x86, @sc{amd} 64, @sc{sparc}, @sc{mips},
@sc{m68k}, Alpha, PowerPC, @dots{}).
@item
Graphics adapter (brand/model, total on-board memory, driver version, @dots{}).
@item
Video settings (color depth, resolution, Crystal Space video driver, @dots{}).
@item
Description of the problem.
@item
Exact error message (or output of Crystal Space). If possible it would be 
nice to get the output of the Crystal Space application with the
@samp{-verbose=-scf} option specified on the command line. On Windows, if you 
are using a gcc based compiler and you compiled in optimize mode then you'll 
also need to add the @samp{-console} option. If you compiled with @sc{msvc} 
and you build in release mode then you'll need the @samp{-noconsole} option.
@item
How to reproduce the crash (if it is reproducible).
@item
A fix for the bug if available (Unified diff files are desirable).
