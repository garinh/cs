@section Map Format Reference
@cindex Map Format Reference

This section contains descriptions of the map format used by Crystal Space.

Note that, despite the word ``map'' in the title, large parts also apply to
the mesh factory, mesh object and library file formats.

The format here is basically described in terms of @sc{xml}, but keep in mind
that Crystal Space internally abstracts the representation and also provides
a binary on-disk representation of maps (@pxref{Binary XML}) -- however,
element names, structure, attributes etc. are the same in all possible
representations.
