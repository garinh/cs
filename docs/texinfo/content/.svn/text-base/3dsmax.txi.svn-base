3DSMax is a very powerful commercial 3D modeller which is supported very
well by Crystal Space.

@subheading Making Levels

For making levels you can use the exporter that is included with Crystal
Space. You can find it in @file{CS/scripts/max}. There is also a manual
there which is located at @file{CS/scripts/max/exporterguide/index.html}.

@subheading Making Models

Models of type Cal3d (@pxref{MeshObject SprCal3D}) can be converted from
3DSMax.
