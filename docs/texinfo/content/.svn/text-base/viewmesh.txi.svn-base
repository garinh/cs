Viewmesh is a tool included with Crystal Space that can be used to
preview models (mesh factories and libraries).

@subheading Commandline Options

@itemize @bullet
@item @samp{-R}
Real path from where to load the model. This option takes a path and
then mounts it to @samp{/tmp/viewmesh}. Then it sets the current
@sc{vfs} directory to that.
@item @samp{-C}
This is the current @sc{vfs} directory to use when loading the model.
If you use this option in combination with @samp{-R} you can change
the current directory relative to @samp{/tmp/viewmesh}.
@item @samp{-L}
Load a library file (for textures or materials for example). This is a
@sc{vfs} path to the library file (possibly relative to the current
@sc{vfs} dir as given by @samp{-R} and @samp{-C}).
@item @samp{-Scale}
Scale the loaded object with the given factor.
@item @samp{-RoomSize}
The model is loaded in a room. With this option you can change the
size of that room. By default the size is 5.
@item @samp{-RenderLoop}
Use another renderloop. By default the standard renderloop is used but you
can also use @samp{diffuse} or @samp{shadowed}.
@end itemize

And then there is an optional filename parameter. Here is an example on how
to use viewmesh:

@example
viewmesh -R=c:\data\gamedata.zip -C=objects/actor factories/genActor
@end example

This example requires some explanation. First we use the @samp{-R} option
to take our game data archive and mount that to @samp{/tmp/viewmesh}.
Then we use the @samp{-C} option to go inside the @samp{objects/actor}
directory that is inside that @sc{zip} archive. And finally we load
the actual model that is still in a deeper directory called
@samp{factories/genActor}. This example demonstrates how it can be useful
to have good control over the current directory in @sc{vfs}. Usually
with models exported from blender2crystal there will be a @samp{factories}
and a @samp{textures} directory. So you want the current directory to be
the parent of those so that the model can reference textures like
@samp{textures/bla.jpg}.
