This document provides information to aid developers during the transition
between versions of Crystal Space.  At this moment Crystal Space is still beta
so changes are sometimes made to procedures and facilities, and the @sc{api}
(@dfn{Application Programmer's Interface}) is not completely frozen.  Even
after version 1.0 is released, changes will still sometimes be unavoidable (but
we will try to minimize them).  The following sections should give you a head
start at trying to convert your application from one release of Crystal Space
to the next.  If you have trouble with something that is not discussed here you
should send mail to the Crystal Space mailing list and ask for help.
