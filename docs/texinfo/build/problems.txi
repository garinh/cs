These problems are relevant for both compiling and running.  Crystal Space is
work in progress.  Expect these problems to go away in the future.

OpenGL: If you are using OpenGL but everything goes in slow motion then it
is possible that you are running software emulated OpenGL. This can happen
if there is a problem with the installation of the OpenGL driver for your
system. Updating that driver might fix this situation. Another problem may
be that you are using a map which uses stencil buffer (like the default map
that is used by walktest and the maps that use stencil shadows). For hardware
accelerated stencil operations you need a 24/32-bit display.

Direct3D: Not currently supported.  (If you would like to write a Direct3D
renderer, please contact us.)
