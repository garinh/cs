Crystal Space was ported to MacOS/X by Eric Sunshine.  If you have questions or
comments about this port, please contact Eric Sunshine at
@email{sunshine@@sunshineco.com}.  Matt Reda added OpenGL, CoreGraphics, and
CoreAudio drivers to the MacOS/X port.  If you have questions or comments about
these drivers, please contact Matt Reda at @email{mreda@@mac.com} or Eric
Sunshine.

This section contains configuration, compilation, installation, and usage
instructions for the MacOS/X port of Crystal Space.  The MacOS/X port of
Crystal Space is built atop Apple's @dfn{Cocoa} technology which Apple
inherited from NeXT and then enhanced.  This port is the progeny of the earlier
NextStep, OpenStep, and MacOS/X Server 1.0 (Rhapsody) ports of Crystal Space by
Eric Sunshine.

Comprehensive and detailed implementation information about the MacOS/X port is
also available (@pxref{MacOS/X Details}).

If you have downloaded a binary-only package of Crystal Space for MacOS/X, you
may want to skip over the following sections explaining how to build Crystal
Space, and jump directly to the section explaining how to run the applications
(@pxref{MacOS/X Running Programs}).

@subsubsection Library Prerequisites

In addition to obtaining the project source code (@pxref{Where to Get}), you
may also want to download and compile several support libraries used for image
manipulation (@pxref{External Libraries}).  The libraries @samp{libpng} and
@samp{libjpeg}, which are present on many Unix installations, are absent from
MacOS/X.  The optional @samp{libmng} is less common.

One way to procure these libraries is to install them with Fink, which is a
tool for installing pre-built Unix and Unix-like tools and resources on
MacOS/X.

@noindent
@uref{http://fink.sourceforge.net/}

Alternately, the libraries can be built manually.  You can download the
required external library source code packages from their canonical download
sites (@pxref{External Libraries}).

If you have permission to do so, it is best to install the @sc{jpeg}, @sc{png},
and @sc{mng} libraries in standard locations by following the installation
instructions for each package (for example @samp{make install}).  In some
cases, these libraries may already be present on your computer if you installed
them separately (via Fink, for instance) or if they were installed by default.
(For example, @sc{zlib}, which is also required by Crystal Space, is already
pre-installed on MacOS/X.)

If you do not have permission to install these libraries, you can still build
Crystal Space by unpacking each external library into the @file{CS/libs}
directory and building them there.  For example:

@example
cd CS/libs
gnutar xfz libpng*.tar.gz
gnutar xfz jpegsrc*.tar.gz
gnutar xfz libmng*.tar.gz
@end example

@noindent
The libraries can be built as follows:

@example
cd CS/libs/libpng*
make -f scripts/makefile.macosx libpng.a

cd ../*jpeg*
sh ./configure
make libjpeg.a

cd ../libmng*
sh ./configure
make libmng.a
@end example

@node MacOS/X Resources, MacOS/X Building, MacOS/X Libraries, MacOS/X
@subsubsection Resources

The standard library archive, @file{standard.zip} and the standard texture
archive, @file{stdtex.zip} are included with the Crystal Space package within
the @file{CS/data} directory.  These files contain resources which are used by
several Crystal Space demonstration programs.  Do not unpack these files;
Crystal Space uses them as-is.

You will also need to have at least one @dfn{map} file in order to use the
Crystal Space demonstration program, WalkTest.  Typically map files should be
placed within the @file{CS/data} directory.  As with other Crystal Space
resources, map files are actually compressed archives which are used directly
by the engine, thus you should not unpack these archives.

The most commonly used map file is @file{flarge} since it demonstrates many of
the special features of the engine rather than focusing on merely one or two
areas.  This map is typically distributed as part of the Crystal Space package
and can be found in the @file{CS/data/flarge} directory.  You can download
additional example map files from the @file{maps} subdirectory of each release
of Crystal Space at the download site:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/support/release/}

@noindent
Be sure to place the map files into the @file{CS/data} directory.

@subsubsection Building

Once you have obtained the latest Crystal Space source code package
(@pxref{Where to Get}) and have installed or prepared the supporting libraries
(@pxref{MacOS/X Libraries}), unpack the source code archive into a convenient
directory as shown below.  A description of the directory hierarchy which is
created when you unpack the source code archive is available,
@ref{Directory Hierarchy}.  A description of the files specific to the MacOS/X
port is also available, @ref{MacOS/X Details}.

@example
gnutar xfz @var{CS-package-name}.tgz
@end example

A note of caution: Take care when obtaining the Crystal Space source code to
ensure that the line-terminators are in Unix format (a single linefeed should
terminate each line).  This is an especially important consideration when
transporting the code from Windows to MacOS/X.  Although many MacOS/X tools
deal gracefully with Windows line-terminators (a carriage-return follwed by a
linefeed), not all tools do so, and may emit apparently inexplicable error
messages when encountering files with Windows line-terminators.  The official
distributions of Crystal Space, including the stable releases and the @sc{svn}
snapshots, are packaged with Unix line-terminators, which are acceptable on all
supported platforms.  These virgin packages themselves can be transported
between Windows and MacOS/X safely

Crystal Space can be built from the command-line (Terminal.app) using either
@file{make} or Jam (@pxref{GettingJam}).  Both tools work equally well.  In the
examples below, wherever @samp{make -k} is used, you can instead substitute
@file{jam} if you so desire.  @emph{Note}: Apple ships a very old and
highly modified version of Jam with MacOS/X which is unsuitable for building
Crystal Space.  If this is the only Jam which you have installed, then just
build Crystal Space using @file{make}.  Alternately, you may download and
install a more recent version of Jam (@pxref{GettingJam}). Jam might also be
available via Fink (though it was not at the time of this writing).

The Crystal Space project consists of a number of components and example
programs.  The following commands are all issued from within the top level
Crystal Space source code directory named @file{CS}.

To begin building Crystal Space, first configure the project for MacOS/X by
typing the following command from within the root @file{CS} directory:

@example
./configure
@end example

At configuration time, you can also specify where Crystal Space should be
installed.  By default, it is installed in several subdirectories of
@file{/usr/local}:

@example
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/etc/crystalspace
/usr/local/include/crystalspace
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/lib/crystalspace
/usr/local/share/crystalspace
/usr/local/share/docs/crystalspace-x.xx
@end example

You can, however, specify a different location if desired.  This setting is
remembered and automatically applied later when you install the project.  For
example:

@example
./configure --prefix=/Library/CrystalSpace
@end example

If you plan to work on Crystal Space itself, as opposed to utilizing Crystal
Space for your own project, you might want to configure Crystal Space to be
built in debug mode:

@example
./configure --enable-debug
@end example

For a full list of configuration options, type:

@example
./configure --help
@end example

If the Crystal Space source directory is read-only, if it is shared between
several developers, or if you simply dislike building a project within its
source tree, you can instead configure and build from a different directory.
For instance:

@example
mkdir $HOME/builddir
cd $HOME/builddir
/path/to/CS/configure --enable-debug
@end example

Once the project has been configured, you can begin building the Crystal Space
demonstration programs.  Alternately, if you are interested in building only
certain components of the system, such as drivers or libraries, then you can do
that instead.

To see a list of all targets which can be built, type:

@example
make help
@end example

The simplest way to build the entire package, including all applications,
drivers, and plug-in modules is to invoke the makefile target @samp{all}:

@example
make -k all
@end example

Alternately, if you are using Jam:

@example
jam all
@end example

This can be a fairly time consuming operation.  If you would like to be more
selective and only build the necessary plug-in modules and a subset of the
available applications, you can invoke their targets individually.

For example, to build all plug-in modules, you could invoke this command:

@example
make -k plugins  # @r{Builds all plug-in modules.}
@end example

To build only the WalkTest application and the plug-in modules which it most
commonly requires use the following target:

@example
make walkall  # @r{Builds WalkTest and most required plug-ins}
@end example

For finer control over which applications and plugins are built, you can invoke
their targets directly.  For instance:

@example
make walktest  # @r{Builds @code{walktest}, the map exploration program}
make glosx2d   # @r{Builds @code{glosx2d}, the MacOS/X OpenGL 2D driver}
make gl3d      # @r{Builds @code{gl3d}, the OpenGL renderer}
@end example

All programs require at least some plug-in modules to be present, so be sure to
build those, as well, by invoking the @samp{plugins} makefile target as
illustrated above if you have not already invoked the @samp{all} target.

Once you have built the project, you will probably want to install it as a
@dfn{software development kit} (@sc{sdk}).  The installation phase installs
everything needed to create your own programs using Crystal Space.  Some
resources, such as demonstration applications and certain data files are not
installed since they are not required for development.  Installing the @sc{sdk}
is optional, though recommended.  If you simply wish to run the example
programs, then you need not invoke the installation phase.

By default, Crystal Space is installed in subdirectories of @file{/usr/local},
however you can specify a different location when you configure the project, as
explained above.  Installation can be performed with the following command:

@example
make install
@end example

Once you have installed the project, you can release disk space used by the
build process:

@example
make distclean
@end example

@subsubsection Using Crystal Space

Crystal Space programs can be run directly from the command-line or from the
Finder.  If you plan to launch programs by double-clicking on them in the
Finder, then you must tell them where to find the resources which they require
to run.  This is accomplished by storing the path to the root of the Crystal
Space directory in the MacOS/X @emph{defaults} database under the name
@samp{CrystalSpaceRoot}.  It is most useful to configure this setting in the
@emph{global} defaults domain.  Depending upon your needs, you can set this to
point at either the installed Crystal Space @sc{sdk} or to the development
directory where you built the project; either location works.

For example, if you have installed Crystal Space at the default location, then
you can tell programs where to find their resources by invoking the following
configuration command from the command-line:

@example
defaults write NSGlobalDomain CrystalSpaceRoot "/usr/local"
@end example

If necessary, it is possible to configure @samp{CrystalSpaceRoot} for a
particular application.  If you do so, this setting will override the global
setting.  For example:

@example
defaults write walktest CrystalSpaceRoot "$HOME/CS"
@end example

It is also possible to instruct Crystal Space applications to ignore the value
of @samp{CrystalSpaceRoot} by assigning the @samp{CrystalSpaceRootIgnore}
option a value of @samp{Yes}.  This is most useful when you would like to have
a particular application ignore the value of @samp{CrystalSpaceRoot} set in the
global domain.  For example:

@example
defaults write walktest CrystalSpaceRootIgnore "Yes"
@end example

Before attempting to run any of the Crystal Space sample applications, ensure
that the files @file{standard.zip} and @file{stdtex.zip} reside in
@file{CS/data} or in the @file{data} directory where Crystal Space is
installed.  These files contain resources and textures which are used by
several of the example programs and map files.

You need to have one or more @dfn{map} files in order to run WalkTest.  These
are the files which contain the maps and rooms which you can explore with
WalkTest.  The most commonly used example map file is @file{flarge}.

You may need adjust the ambient lighting which the engine applies when it
lights the maps.  This may be necessary if you find that the scenes appears too
dark.  You can do this by setting ambient lighting values via the following
configuration commands from the command-line.  The default value for these
settings is 20.  If that is too dark for you, try using a higher value.
For example:

@example
defaults write CrystalSpace.Global Engine.Lighting.Ambient.Red 50
defaults write CrystalSpace.Global Engine.Lighting.Ambient.Green 50
defaults write CrystalSpace.Global Engine.Lighting.Ambient.Blue 50
@end example

If you want ambient lighting to apply to only a single application, or if you
want to override the global setting with an application-specific setting,
replace @samp{CrystalSpace.Global} in the above commands with
@samp{CrystalSpace.Application} where @samp{Application} is the name of the
application (for example, @samp{CrystalSpace.Walktest}).

To specify options when running programs, you must invoke the programs from the
command-line, however the need to specify command-line options is rare, so this
should not prove much of an inconvenience.

To run WalkTest with a particular map (for instance, @file{flarge}), type:

@example
./walktest.app/Contents/MacOS/walktest flarge
@end example

Once invoked, you will be able to explore the map file (@file{flarge}) by using
the navigation controls (@pxref{Walktest Movement}).  To explore a different
map, substitute its name in place of @samp{flarge}.

If you would like to explore a map other than @samp{flarge} without having to
type it on the command-line, you can add the following setting to the MacOS/X
defaults database.  This will allow you to explore different maps even when
launching WalkTest from the Finder.  For example, to explore a map named
@samp{castle}, set the following default value:

@example
defaults write CrystalSpace.Walktest Walktest.Settings.WorldFile castle
@end example

Other interesting applications, such as csDemo, also come with
Crystal Space.

Crystal Space renders the 3D scenes with the OpenGL renderer.  Some
versions of the MacOS/X operating system ship with OpenGL drivers which do not
not perform particularly well with the Crystal Space OpenGL renderer, and this
problem could result in poor frame rates.

Crystal Space renders 3D scenes in a window by default, however you can
instruct the applications to use @dfn{full-screen} mode with the @samp{--fs}
command-line option.  For example:

@example
./walktest.app/Contents/MacOS/walktest --fs flarge
@end example

Alternately, if you prefer to launch programs from the Finder, you can install
the following default setting to enable full-screen mode for all Crystal Space
applications:

@example
defaults write CrystalSpace.Global Video.FullScreen yes
@end example

It is also possible to enable full-screen mode selectively only for certain
applications.  For example, to enable full-screen mode only for CsDemo
by default, you could apply this default setting:

@example
defaults write CrystalSpace.csdemo Video.FullScreen yes
@end example

On the MacOS/X, Crystal Space will pause execution when the window is
de-activated, and resume execution when the window is re-activated.  Paused
state is indicated by the text ``[Paused]'' in the title of the window.  If you
wish to disable this behavior, and allow programs to run even when the window
is not active, apply this setting to your defaults database:

@example
defaults write CrystalSpace.Global System.RunWhenNotFocused yes
@end example

You can also use the command-line option @samp{--alwaysruns}.
