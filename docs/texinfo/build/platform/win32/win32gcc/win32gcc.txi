These instructions are for building Crystal Space with MinGW, the
@emph{Minimalist @sc{gnu} compiler for Windows}.

@subsubheading Necessary Resources

Download the following packages:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The most recent version of the MinGW compiler and related tools.  This package
is typically named @file{MinGW-?.?.?-?.exe}, where the question marks stand for
the actual version number.

@noindent
@uref{http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/}

Or:

@uref{http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml}

@item
The most recent version of @sc{msys}.  This is an adjunct package for MinGW
which provides additional useful utilities as well as a convenient shell
environment.  @sc{msys} provides a more reliable and robust environment for the
configuration and build phases of Crystal Space.  It is available from the
MinGW web site.  This package is typically named @file{MSYS-?.?.?.exe}, where
the question marks stand for the actual version number.

@item
The most recent Crystal Space Win32 Libs package.  This package provides a set
of additional required and optional resources used when building Crystal Space,
such as zlib, libpng, libjpeg, @sc{ode}, @sc{nasm} (the Netwide Assembler),
etc.  @xref{cs-win32libs}.

@subsubheading Installation

Follow these instructions to install the packages which you downloaded.
Be sure to install them in the order shown.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Install the MinGW compiler.  The is a self-extracting executable.  The
following instructions assume you will install the MinGW package at
@file{C:\mingw32}, though you are free to install it wherever you like.

@item
Install @sc{msys}.  This is a self-extracting executable.  During the
installation, you will be asked for the location of the MinGW installation.
This allows @sc{msys} to correctly locate the MinGW tools later on when
building Crystal Space.  Be sure to enter the correct path (@file{C:/mingw32},
in our example) when prompted.

@item
Install the @file{cs-win32libs} package.  This is a self-extracting executable.
After the installation, you should opt to also install support for the
@sc{msys} development environment.  This will augment the @sc{msys} shell
startup file so a helper script named @file{cslibs-config} can be found when
configuring Crystal Space.  This script is used by the Crystal Space configure
script to determine where the rest of the @file{cs-win32libs} resources are
located.

You may want to select ``MSYS/MinGW typical'' in the ``Select Components'' 
screen. You can further adjust the selection of installed components depending 
on your actual set up (e.g. install VisualC-related components if you plan to 
also use CrystalSpace with VisualC++).
@end itemize

@emph{Note}: If you ever install a new version of @sc{msys}, then you should 
also re-install the @file{cs-win32libs} package.

@subsubheading Building Crystal Space

You must configure and build Crystal Space from within the @sc{msys} shell
environment.  To launch this environment, click on the @sc{msys} icon which the
installation procedure placed upon your desktop, or choose the @sc{msys} item
from the @emph{Programs} menu.  This will launch a Unix-like shell window into
which you type commands.

Crystal Space can be built with either @file{make} or Jam (@pxref{GettingJam}).
Both tools work equally well.  The @file{cs-win32libs} package contains a
pre-built version of Jam which you can invoke simply by typing @samp{jam} at
the @sc{msys} command prompt.  In the examples below, wherever @samp{jam}
is used, you can instead substitute @file{make -k} if you so desire.

At the shell prompt, go to your @file{CS} directory with the @samp{cd} command.
For example, if Crystal Space resides at @file{C:\work\CS}, invoke the command
@samp{cd /c/work/CS}.  Next, configure and build the project with the following
sequence of commands:

@example
./configure
jam
@end example

If you prefer to build a @dfn{debug} version of Crystal Space, substitute
the following commands for those shown above:

@example
./configure --enable-debug
jam
@end example

If the Crystal Space source directory is read-only, if it is shared between
several developers, or if you simply dislike building a project within its
source tree, you can instead configure and build from a different directory.
For instance:

@example
mkdir $HOME/builddir
cd $HOME/builddir
/c/work/CS/configure --enable-debug
jam
@end example

Finally, if you want to utilize Crystal Space as a software development kit
(@sc{sdk}), you can install it and then clean up the detritus of the build
process:

@example
jam install
jam distclean
@end example

@subsubheading Additional Build Options

Sometimes it is a good idea to remove all of the built programs and executable
files and start from scratch.  You can do this with the following commands:

@example
jam clean
jam
@end example

Once in a while it is even a good idea to completely clean and re-configure the
project.  This may be required if you are using the bleeding-edge version of
Crystal Space from the @sc{svn} repository after some radical change.

@example
jam distclean
./configure
jam
@end example

@subsubheading Troubleshooting

If you successfully built Crystal Space, yet find that you can not run the
applications from the @file{CS\} root directory, a possible cause might be that
the pathname leading up to the @file{CS\} directory might have embedded
whitespace.  For instance, if you installed the project in @file{C:\my
stuff\CS}, try renaming the path to @file{C:\my_stuff\CS} or
@file{C:\mystuff\CS}.

@subheading Blasting the Past

If you were previously using the older, deprecated @file{cs_mingw_0.??.exe}
package which contained the entire MinGW distribution along with other
unrelated tools and resources, or the @file{csmingwlibs} package, it is highly
recommended that you first remove the older package, as well as any residual
files and resources before installing the newer MinGW, @sc{msys}, and
@file{cs-win32libs} packages.  For best results, it would probably be wise to
remove the entire old @file{MinGW} directory (though you may want to make a
backup copy of it just in case) and clean your environment variables of any
references to the old resource directories.
