@section External Libraries

Crystal Space may utilize several optional external, and publicly available
development libraries.  These libraries are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
zlib
@item
libpng
@item
libjpeg
@item
X Window System
@item
OpenGL
@item
Freetype2
@item
@sc{cg}
@item
@sc{ode}
@item
Bullet
@item
Cal3D
@item
lib3ds
@item
Ogg/Vorbis
@item
libmng
@item
@sc{cegui}
@item
wxWidgets
@end itemize

Most of these libraries are optional.  If you do not have them installed, then
Crystal Space will still function, though features related to the missing
libraries will be disabled.  Despite being optional, at the very minimum, you
should at least ensure that zlib, libpng, and libjpeg are installed since much
useful functionality depends upon those libraries.  Many computer systems come
with these libraries pre-installed.  If the libraries are not already available
on your system, then see the following sections for information about how to
obtain them.

If you need to install some of the libraries yourself pay attention to the
versions states below. 

@itemize @bullet
@item 
``Required'' means that you need to install exactly 
the version stated, otherwise Crystal Space can not use the library. 
@item 
``Recommended'' means that the version stated is known to work well with 
Crystal Space, however, older or newer versions may work as well. If you have
a choice between multiple versions for a library, pick the recommended one.
@item
``Minimum'' means that a library needs to be at least of the version stated,
but newer versions are very likely to work as well and can be chosen.

@subheading The ``cs-winlibs'' Package
@cindex Windows, Building
@anchor{cs-win32libs}

Rather than having to install these components manually, Microsoft Visual C++ 
8/9, MinGW/MSYS, and Cygwin users can download a single package which
contains all common headers, pre-built library files, and dynamic link 
libraries in pre-compiled form, all in versions known to work with this
particular release of Crystal Space. You can obtain it from the following
location:

@subheading zlib
@cindex zlib
@cindex Libraries, zlib
@cindex Compression library, zlib

@emph{Version:} 1.0 minimum

Crystal Space relies upon the @code{zlib} library for reading @sc{zip} files,
and for a few other uses.  You can download @code{zlib} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.gzip.org/zlib/}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
install}) or unpack it into the directory @file{CS/libs/zlib*}.  In general, if
you have permission to do so, it is best to install the library.

@subheading libpng
@cindex libpng
@cindex Libraries, libpng
@cindex PNG library

@emph{Version:} 1.2.x minimum

Crystal Space relies upon the @code{libpng} library for reading @sc{png}
graphic files.  You can download @code{libpng} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
-f scripts/makefile.std install}) or unpack it into the directory
@file{CS/libs/libpng*}.  In general, if you have permission to do so, it is
best to install the library.

@subheading libjpeg
@cindex libjpeg
@cindex Libraries, libjpeg
@cindex JPEG library

@emph{Version:} 6b minimum

Crystal Space relies upon the @code{libjpeg} library for reading @sc{jpeg}
graphic files.  You can download @code{libjpeg} from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.ijg.org/files/}

After downloading you can either install the package normally (i.e. @samp{make
install}) or unpack it into the directory @file{CS/libs/jpeg*}.  In general,
if you have permission to do so, it is best to install the library.

@subheading X Window System
@cindex X Window System
@cindex Libraries, X Window System

This is needed to enable graphical output on a number of Unix-like operating 
systems, most prominently @sc{gnu}/Linux.  It is @emph{not} needed for Windows
or MacOS/X.

The exact installation procedure depends on the operating system/distribution 
you're using.  If you are, what is likely, running a graphical desktop, the
needed runtime components of the X Window System are installed and functioning
on your system.  However, development components (headers and libraries) may 
still have to be installed.  It is outside the scope of this manual to detail
how this is done on the various distributions and platforms, please refer to
other resources for that.

@subheading OpenGL
@cindex OpenGL
@cindex Libraries, OpenGL

OpenGL is needed to provide accelerated 3D graphics @emph{on all platforms}.

No special effort is usually needed to install the development components on
Windows or MacOS/X, as the various Development Kits for that platform 
generally contain the headers and libraries needed to utilize OpenGL.

For other platforms the exact installation procedure depends on the operating 
system/distribution you're using.  While the runtime components are usually
installed when a graphical desktop is used, development components may 
still have to be.  It is outside the scope of this manual to detail how this 
is done on the various distributions and platforms, please refer to other 
resources for that.
