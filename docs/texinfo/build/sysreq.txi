@cindex Requirements

To utilize Crystal Space you need at least the following resources.

@strong{Hardware}: To fully utilize the 3D engine a 3D-accelerated graphics
card is highly recommended. The minimum recommended processor on the
x86 architecture is one of the i586 family (Pentium).

@strong{Operating System}: You will need to be running a supported Operating
System.  Currently Crystal Space supports: Windows (32 bit), Unix
(@sc{gnu}/Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), and MacOS/X.

@strong{Development Environment}: You may build Crystal Space yourself, or you
may download a pre-built @sc{sdk} package.  If you are using the @sc{svn}
version of Crystal Space, then you will need to build it yourself.  To do so
you will need a supported C++ compiler such as the @sc{gnu} Compiler Collection
(@sc{gcc} - versions known to work well are 3.4 and above, with the exception
of versions 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 which produce buggy code for Crystal Space) or 
Microsoft Visual C++, version 8.0 (aka .net 2005) and above (versions 6 to
7.1 are not supported).  If you plan to use the scripting
capabilities of Crystal Space you will also need an interpreter for each
scripting language you use.

@strong{Crystal Space Package}: The latest release of Crystal Space can be
downloaded from:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Download}

The release includes all of the source code, some pre-generated documentation,
and a few example data files.  Alternately, you can download the latest
@sc{svn} snapshot, which is often a great improvement over the latest release,
and often as, or more, stable.

@noindent
@uref{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/cvs-snapshots/}

You can also checkout the source directly from the @sc{svn} repository.
Directions for doing this can be found here:

@noindent
@uref{http://www.crystalspace3d.org/main/Subversion}

@strong{External Dependencies}: Crystal Space can use a number of optional
libraries and tools to provide a more robust set of features.  A brief list of
the most important dependencies is presented here.  @xref{External Libraries}.

@table @asis
@item Z Library
zlib is used for compression and archiving.

@noindent
@uref{http://www.gzip.org/zlib/}

@item @sc{png} Library
libpng is used for loading Portable Network Graphics image files.

@noindent
@uref{http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html}

@item @sc{jpeg} Library
libjpeg is used for loading @emph{Joint Photographics Experts Group} image
files.

@noindent
@uref{http://www.ijg.org/files/}

@item X Window System
This is needed to enable graphical output on a number of Unix-like operating 
systems, most prominently @sc{gnu}/Linux. It is @emph{not} needed for Windows
or MacOS/X.

@item OpenGL
OpenGL is needed to provide accelerated 3D graphics @emph{on all platforms}.

Note that no special effort is usually needed to install the development 
components on Windows or MacOS/X.

@item Jam
@anchor{GettingJam}
Jam is a @file{make} replacement with a much more intuitive and expressive file
format.  Internally, the Crystal Space build system is predicated upon Jam,
however Crystal Space also features a @file{make} @dfn{emulation} layer which
allows you to build and install the project using @file{make}, so there is no
strict need to download or install Jam.  If, however, you plan to work on the
Crystal Space build system or create your own external project based upon Jam,
then you can download it from this location:

@noindent
@uref{ftp://ftp.perforce.com/jam/}

@noindent
Jam documentation can be found at the Jam home page; see @file{Jam.html},
@file{Jambase.html}, and @file{Jamfile.html}.

@noindent
@uref{http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html}

Jam is included pre-built in the @file{cs-win32libs} convenience package
(@pxref{cs-win32libs}), so Mingw and Cygwin users who use that package get Jam
for free.  Other users will want to build it from source code.  For such users,
once Jam has been downloaded, follow these simple steps to build and install
it.  These instructions illustrate Jam 2.5, which is current as of this
writing.

@example
unzip jam-2.5.zip
cd jam-2.5
make
./jam0 install
@end example

If you are a Unix user, then you will probably need to have administrator
privilege to install the executable since it will be installed as
@file{/usr/local/bin/jam}.  To gain administrator privilege, you can use the
@samp{sudo} command:

@example
sudo ./jam0 install
@end example

If you want to install Jam at a location other than the default, then set the
@samp{BINDIR} variable to the directory in which you want it installed (this
example shows it being installed in the user's private @file{$HOME/bin}
directory):

@example
./jam0 -sBINDIR=$HOME/bin install
@end example

@end table
