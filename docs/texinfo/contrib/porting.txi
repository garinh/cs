@section Porting to a New Platform
@cindex Porting

This section provides information useful to developers who wish to port
Crystal Space to new platforms.

Before undertaking the job of porting Crystal Space to a new platform one
should, at least marginally, familiarize one's self with the various modules
which comprise the package. A good way to gain such an overview is to read
the Chapter about the internal structure of Crystal Space (@pxref{Internals}),
as well as the chapter about using Crystal Space (@pxref{Using Crystal Space}).

Once you have gained an overview of structure of Crystal Space, the first step
in porting is to check the file @file{include/types.h} and see if it conforms
to your system.  This file defines various types and constants which may need
to be customized for a particular platform.  If you have a system with
uncommon sizes for integers (for example 32-bit @samp{short} values) then you
may need to adjust the definitions contained within this file.  However, for
most platforms this file may be used as-is.

@emph{FIXME}: Flesh out the remainder of this discussion.
