@c -*-texinfo-*-
The Crystal Space project welcomes contribution from the Open Source
community.  This is how the project grows and extends its functionality.  We
accept bug fixes, new code, ideas, etc.

If you have an idea about a new feature, or about the possible
solution or hints on a bug, but you don't have program code, you should
contact the mailing list.  @xref{Mailing Lists}.

If you would like to contribute documentation, please read
@ref{Writing Documentation}.

If you wish to contribute code, you should first read @ref{Coding Style}.  If
you are a registered Crystal Space developer with write-access to the @sc{svn}
repository, then before you commit changes, you should also read
@ref{SVN Guide}.

If you are not a registered developer, but still have code or bug fixes to
submit, you can send your code to any developer with write access to the 
@sc{svn} repository.  To see which developers have write-access, look at the 
Crystal Space web page on SourceForge (@uref{http://www.sourceforge.net/}).  
It is also acceptable to send small changes or patches to the Crystal Space 
mailing list. If all else fails, you can always send your code to the project 
administrators Jorrit Tyberghein (@email{jorrit.tyberghein@@gmail.com}), 
Eric Sunshine (@email{sunshine@@sunshineco.com}), Frank Richter 
(@email{res@@crystalspace3d.org}) or M@aa{}rten Svanfeldt 
(@email{developer@@svanfeldt.com}) for inclusion in the project.

If you would like to contribute to the project in general by working on
features which are missing or lacking, you might want to see the To-Do
list at the Developer's Project page at SourceForge:

@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/crystal/}

You can also contact the mailing list and ask about unfinished items first
hand.  If you want to help with bug fixing, and you have an idea about a bug
send a message to the mailing list.  If you have an actual fix for a bug,
please send it to the developers.  @xref{Mailing Lists}.
