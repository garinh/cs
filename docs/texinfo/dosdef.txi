@c
@c    Windows/DOS-specific configuration for Texinfo.
@c
@c    This file defines @import{} and @picture{} macros for including other
@c    Texinfo and image files which reside in subdirectories.  Use the
@c    @import{} and @picture{} macros rather than Texinfo's @include and
@c    @image{} commands, respectively.
@c
@c    Neither TeX nor the Texinfo tools (makeinfo, texi2html, etc.) deal
@c    gracefully with differences in pathname syntax between various platforms
@c    (such as Unix, Windows/DOS, Macintosh, etc.).  The @import{} and
@c    @picture{} macros defined by this file take platform-specific pathname
@c    syntax into account and act appropriately.
@c
@c    To import a Texinfo file from the current directory, use @import{}.  To
@c    import a file from within an immediate subdirectory, use @imports{}.
@c    Use @importss{} for a file two directories deep; @importsss{} for a file
@c    three levels deep; and so on.  For example, to include the file
@c    "bar.texi" which resides within an immediate subdirectory named "foo",
@c    use the command @imports{foo,bar.texi}.
@c
@c    The @picture{} macros work similarly.  Use @picture{} to import an image
@c    from the current directory; @pictures{} for a file from an immediate
@c    subdirectory; @picturess{} for a file two directories deep, and so on.
@c    Unlike Texinfo's @image{} directive, @picture{} does not allow manual
@c    specification of the image's dimensions.
@c
@c NOTES
@c    The practice of adding an "s" to the name of the @import{} and
@c    @picture{} directives was chosen on account of the extremely limited
@c    macro handling capabilities within the Texinfo language, since it does
@c    not provide any mechanism for gracefully handling a variable number of
@c    arguments.
@c
@c    Texinfo to HTML conversion via texi2html requires version 1.60 or later
@c    since earlier versions do not understand the @macro directive.
@c
@c TODO / BUGS
@c    The TeX versions of @import{} do not (yet) deal gracefully with
@c    underscores ("_") in pathname components.  Unfortunately, TeX treats the
@c    underscore as a subscripting operator.
