This is a MAX script for exporting genmesh skeletal animation2 from 
3D Studio Max (tested on versions 6, 7 and 8).

Some notes:
 - Exporter support Character Studio bones (Bipeds) and
   simple bones. Both can be used together too. Also it
   supports Physique and Skin modifiers.
 - In case that you use Character Studio and Physique modifier:
   - Copy IPhysique.gup to your max_dir/plugins and restart MAX.
   - After biped creation use `physique modifier'.
- All vertices should be "rigid" type when rigging model.
- The model material must be of type "Multimaterial" - each 
  group of material faces will be exported as separate submesh.
  This is because genmesh skeleton animation 2 supports ~40
  bones per mesh. If your mesh consists of >40 bones you
  can split it in 2 or more material faces groups (submaterials 
  must be Standard materials in the multimaterial) by taking care 
  that each material group is not connected to more than 40 
  bones.
- When model is done face it in Y direction.
- Add Dummy object, call it "root" and set it as parent to 
  the root skeleton bone (Bip01 if you use Character studio).
- If you want relative root bone animation uncheck
  "Parent dummy movable". In this mode you can make rotation
  or movement in some direction relative by setting the
  constraint checkboxes (STILL VERY EXPERIMENTAL).
