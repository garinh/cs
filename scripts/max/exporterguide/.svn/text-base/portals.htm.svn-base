<h3> Portals</h3>
<p>Portals are a very important tool to speed up the rendering of levels. Well 
  defined sectors can greatly speed up rendering and allow various tricks, to 
  understand what they are, read <a href="sectors.htm">this</a> guide.</p>
<p>CS uses portals to connect different <a href="sectors.htm">sectors</a>. A portal 
  can be for example a door or a window that connects the interior of an house 
  to the exterior. In that case the interior will be one sector, the exterior 
  another one.<br>
  <br>
  To add a portal to a 3dsmax scene follow this guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the object name must start with "_p_" . For example "_p_laanx1" 
    is a valid portal name.</li>
  <li>it MUST be a mesh with 2 planar triangle polygons (a square similar to a 
    door is perfect).</li>
  <li>add a property to the object (see 'Objects' chapter for details on how to 
    add a property) called "PORTAL" that points to the roomname of the 
    sector where that portal will lead to.<br>
    Example: PORTAL=plaza</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  Please note than the exporter will produce 1 sector per exported scene , so 
  if you want to make a level with many sectors: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Create different max scene (one per sector ) </li>
  <li>Merge them to see if they fit correctly toghether </li>
  <li>Export each one separatly</li>
  <li>Merge the exported files. (PS team developed a simple tool for merging).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
