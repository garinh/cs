<h3> Objects Properties</h3>
<p>There are a number of supported CS properties that you can set in 3dsmax. Some 
  are based on the naming convention others are defined as properties of the object 
  in 3dsmax. To set a property in 3dsmax just select the object and right-click 
  to open the object menu. Select "Properties...", then the tab "User Defined". 
  In that window you can add the properties of the object. Be sure to use same 
  case, properties are case sensitive.</p>

    <td><b>Player Barrier</b></td>
    <td>If you need one object to be invisible and to block players (they can't 
      pass through it), then define the object as a &quot;player barrier&quot;.</td>

    <td> Changes lightmap so the object will appear more round, if the object 
      is not exposed to a light, it will not look rounded.<br>

      disable shadows on static objects using that setting. Default is casting 
      shadows.<br> <p></p>

    <td> You can set some faces to be invisible in CS. Imagine you have a box, 
      but you want 1 face to be invisible. You can surely remove that face, but 
      it seems that Dynavis works better if you keep that face and set it as invisible. 
      So Dynavis will consider the object closed, and you will have the same visual 
      effect. To set a face as invisible, create a new material with texture "csinvisible.tga" 
      (this IS case-sensitive) and assign it to the faces you want to be invisible. 
    </td>
    <td>Those faces will be flagged as LIGHTING=no and INVISIBLE=yes.

    <td> <p><b>Transparency:</b> </td>
    <td> <p>If an object has a transparent texture you need no special flag on 
        the object itself. You have to set the texture as transparent. To do that, 
        open the material editor, pick your material and select the &quot;Opacity&quot; 
        checkbox. It's not needed that you also add a texture for it.</p>
      <p></p></td>

    <td>NO</td>
