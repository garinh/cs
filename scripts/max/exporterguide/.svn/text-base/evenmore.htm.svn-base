  Well, you asked for it and you ll get it. If you have read this guide you might 
  have understood than the exporter exports into a format who is not only used 
  by PlaneShift, but by the graphic engine who use it, so here are a few links 
  to things that you might find interesting, they point to the crystalspace documentation. 
  In reality I didn't try those features by myself, but they are more likely going 
  to works, as anything than who works with crystalspace in general should works 
  with PlaneShift.<br>
  <br>
  Please notice than all these features require than you edit the world file by 
  yourself, if you know what XML is it's better as the world file use an xml-like 
  grammar, if you don't know you should be smart enough to undertand how it works 
  by looking at the examples.<br>
  <br>
  First a quick link to the <a href="http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/online/manual/cs_205.php#SEC471">format 
  of a map file section</a> it's easier to edit something when you know how it 
  works, isn't it ? <br>
  Then an other to some <a href="http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/online/manual/cs_214.php#SEC530" >interesting 
  object</a> than you can use <br>
  Your map isn t rendering fast enough ? You can plan to use <a href="http://crystal.sourceforge.net/docs/online/manual/cs_202.php#SEC460">LOD 
  ( level of detail )</a> <br>
  You might find very difficult to add particles systems, because for meshes you 
  can use your favorite modeler, then import the mesh into PS, but for particles, 
  you can only guess how it will looks like depending on the values you used this 
  is why there is an app named partedit than you should find at the root of the 
  "CS" directory.</p>

<h2><a name="priority">Rendering Priorities</a></h2>
<p>Just as s reference.</p>
<p>In Crystal Space you can define rendering priorities for objects. Currently 
  we assign priorities with these rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all "_t_" objects have "alpha" priority</li>
  <li>all "_sky_" objects have "sky" priority</li>
  <li>all "_p_" objects have "wall" priority</li>
  <li>all "_s_" objects have "object" priority</li>
  <li>all others objects have "object" priority</li>
</ul>
<p>CS renders objects in this sequence:</p>
<ol>
  <li>sky</li>
  <li>wall</li>
  <li>object</li>
  <li>alpha</li>
</ol>
