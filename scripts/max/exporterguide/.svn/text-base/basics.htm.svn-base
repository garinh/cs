<h2>Modeling a level to be exported</h2>
<p>To be sure that the level you are modeling will be exported correctly, you 
  must follow these guidelines. The ones marked as &quot;Required&quot; are necessary. 
  If you don't do that the level will not export.</p>
<h3>1. Room Properties (Required)</h3>
<table><tr><td><p>Set the sector name by clicking on File&gt;File Properties. Select the Custom 
  Tab, enter this data:</p>
<p>Name: roomname<br>
  Type: Text<br>
  Value: &lt;enter the roomname, e.g. laanxinside&gt;</p>
<p>Click on Add.</p>
      <h3>2. Starting Position (Required)</h3>
<p>Every sector in CS has a starting position, this is where the player will appear. 
  To set that we use the position of a 'Camera' object placed in the Max scene.</p>
<p>Click on Create-&gt;Cameras, select 'Target', place the camera where you want 
  the starting position to be. If multiple cameras are present, the exporter uses 
  the first one.</p>

      <h3>3. Objects</h3>
      <p>As a general guideline one object in Max is exported as one object in 
        CS. The type of object exported depends by the name you give to it. If 
        the name starts with any chars not included in the categories below, the 
        object is exported as a standard mesh object.<br>
        <br>
        _g_ : are exported as genmeshes<br>
        _f_ : are exported as thingmeshes<br>
        _p_: are exported as portal objects.<br>
        _s_ : are exported as static objects<br>
        _sky_ : is exported as a skybox<br>
        _occ_: occluder objects, used to speed up rendering<br>
        _n_: are not exported at all </p>
      <h3>4. Textures</h3>
      <p>Both Standard Materials and Multi/Sub Materials are supported. The name 
        of the texture is NOT important, the exporter looks at the actual filename 
        attached to the material. Features like bump mapping are not supported 
        for now. Please define all your texture just with the &quot;Diffuse&quot; 
        option, attaching an image.</p>
      <p>For trasparent textures see Invisible Faces in the <a href="object.htm">object 
        section</a>.</p>
