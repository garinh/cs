<h3>Level of Detail</h3>
<p>In PlaneShift we can use Level Of Detail (LOD) to reduce the number of polygons 
  rendered when a model is very far from the player. This is achieved by having 
  different models for the same object that have a decreasing number of polygons. 
  So you can have a tree modeled in 3 versions, one with 80 polygons, a second 
  with 40 polygons and a third with 16 polygons. The engine will calculate the 
  distance between the player and the object and it will render the correct version 
  accordingly. The idea behind is that at far distance the 16 polygons tree will 
  look very similar (if not identical) to the high poly one.</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: Right now LOD works only with genmeshes, do not use with other 
  type of objects.</p>
<p>To implement LOD in your level follow these steps:</p>
<p>1) Create a genmesh factory and some instances as explained <a href="thinggenmesh.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>2) Create two lower poly version of the genmesh factory. Those must be positioned 
  as other factories (check the genmesh chapter). Name those _n_something so those 
  will not be exported as normal objects.</p>
<p>3) Set these properties on the first genmesh factory (the one at higher res)</p>
<p>LODLOW: it's the name of the genmesh factory model with low polygons<br>
  LODMED: it's the name of the genmesh factory model with medium polygons</p>
<p>Example:<br>
  LODLOW=_n_newtree_lodlow<br>
  LODMED=_n_newtree_lodmed</p>
<p>If you want you can specify &quot;null&quot; for one of the two variables. 
  In that case the mesh will disappear at that distance.</p>
<p>4) Set two custom properties on the Max scene:</p>
<p>lodmax: is the distance at which will be rendered the model with max number 
  of polygons. If you don't specify it the default is 50<br>
  lodmin: is the distance at which will be rendered the model with min number 
  of polygons. If you don't specify it the default is 200<br>
