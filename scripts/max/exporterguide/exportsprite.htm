<h2>Export Sprite</h2>
<p>Select PlaneShift-&gt;Export Sprite.</p>
 we have 2 ways to export our chars
 an old one and a new one
 the old one just takes a number of mseconds and use this info to switch from one frame to the other
 so it renders the first frame, then wait 100 msec, then second frame, then 100 msec...etcc
 the problem of that method is that the number of frames in the animation makes the difference on the speed of the char
 also if a char has short legs or long legs if doesn't make difference
 so we have the new method to fix that.
<br><br>
 the new method calculates the displacements of the feet of the char.
<p> "vertex on foot" is one vertex that moves with the character.

those vertexes will be used to calculate displacement from one frame to
the other, so it can be one random vertex of the foot. We choosed the
outermost one to the back of the foot.
 so you provide 2 vertexes, one for each feet
 and it calculates the real movement of the vertex
 the "displacement" of the vertex
 based on that it moves the char in game.
first foot on air is "foot 1"

 "frame with foot 2 on the ground" is the first frame where the second foot touches the ground
 from that point on, the displacement is calculated on vertex 2 and not on vertex 1</p>

 <h3>Notes :</h3>
 
 Please note that this guide is in fact a bit outdated as now CrystalSpace use the Cal3d library for character animation , so here are some link to help u with character import
 
<br>The <a href="http://cal3d.sourceforge.net/index.html" target="_new">cal3d site</a> itself
<br>The cal3d <a href="http://cal3d.sourceforge.net/modeling/tutorial.html" target="_new">modeling tutorial</a>
<br>A collection of free <a href="http://www.e-motek.com/stockmoves/" target="_new">motion capture</a> files from <a href="http://www.e-motek.com/">e-motek</a> to help u getting realistic character movement
<br><a href="http://www.e-motek.com/entertainment/stockmoves/tutorials.html" target="_new">Here</a> are the tutorials you should follow to get those file used propertly
<br>If you want some really detailled info about crystalspace and cal3d i sugest you the pdf you can find on <a href="http://graphics.cs.lth.se/theses/projects/crystalcharacter/page_project.html" target="_new">this site</a>
