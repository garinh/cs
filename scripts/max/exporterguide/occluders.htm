<h3>Occluders</h3>
<p>The engine supports the concept of &quot;occluders&quot;. An occluder is usually 
  a box-shaped object that is placed inside other more complex geoemtry or behind 
  it, to speed up rendering. For example if you have a wall, and behind it a big 
  number of objects, will be good to place an occluder object inide of that wall. 
  Occluders are used when dynavis is used.</p>
<p>To define an occluder object you just have to name it with the prefix &quot;_occ_&quot;.</p>
<p>It's best if you use &quot;Box&quot; objects instead of &quot;Editable Mesh&quot; 
  objects, so it will be used in the engine as a native element of type box.</p>
