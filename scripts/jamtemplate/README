The createproject.sh script can set up a skeleton project with a build system
based upon Jam for external Crystal Space projects.  It sets up Jam support,
Autoconf macros, a configure script, MSVC project file generation capability, a
source directory, and a few rudimentary source and header files.

To run the script, set your CRYSTAL environment variable, and go to some
directory under which you want to have the project created.  Then, just invoke
the script. If the Crystal Space SDK has been installed, then the script will
reside at:

${prefix}/share/crystalspace/build/jamtemplate/createproject.sh

where ${prefix} is the installation location (typically, /usr/local).
Alternately, you can invoke the script directly from the Crystal Space source
tree, where it resides at:

CS/scripts/jamtemplate/createproject.sh

Also see the HOWTO named "Creating an External Crystal Space Application" in
the Crystal Space manual for additional details.
